            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Grace and Peace to the wise and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have laboured in this Dialogue to explicate the meritorious price of our Redemption, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adoption, and to clear it from some common Errors, hoping that others who are better learned, will take occasion by this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to do it more thoroughly.</p>
            <p>I find variety of opinions touching the point of Christs satisfaction for our Redemption, and Justification: namely, what it was that he did or suffer'd to satisfie Gods wrath for our Redemption and Justification.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some hold that Christ did satisfie Gods Justice for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the curse of the Law, by bearing the said curse for us: and they stick not to affirm it in these terms: The curse of the Law: The wrath of God: The torments of Hell: The pains of the Damned: The second Death, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others will not indure such harsh terms, as some of these are, and yet they affirm that Christ did suffer the wrath of God for our Redemption, namely, so much of it as was eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivalent to the punishment of the sins of the Elect: See Mr. <hi>Iacob</hi> upon Christs sufferings, <hi>pa.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others do affirm that Christ did not suffer that kind of wrath which the damned do suffer, but that kind of wrath only which the Elect do suffer in this life; but yet in a far greater measure, and thus Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> did at last explain his apprehensions in a letter to my self (having had two or three turns in writing, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.)</p>
            <p>Such jarring there is among Divines, about the kind of sufferings which they say Christ bare for our Redemption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others disagree about the part of Christs human nature, that did bear the wrath of God for our Redemption: for some affirme that Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul only, and not in his body: 2. Others affirm that he suffered the wrath of God in his
<pb facs="tcp:117340:3"/> body, as well as in his soul, to redeem our bodies from Gods wrath, as well as our souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others do not agree about the time when Christ did first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to suffer the wrath of God; nor how long he bare it ere it ceased, neither do they clear it; whether it continued constant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him without any intermission, from the first time that the wrath of God did seize upon him, untill his death, or untill his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>These things are not cleared by those Divines that hold that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, by suffering the said curse for us.</p>
            <p>But I have laboured in this Treatise to prove that Christ did not suffer any degree of Gods wrath at all for us, but that all his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were inflicted upon him from the rage and enmity of the old Serpent and his wicked instruments, being all comprised under this one sentence, Thou shalt pierce him in the footsoals, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And yet I grant also that God had a hand in all his sufferings, because Satan and his instruments could inflict no other punishments upon Christ, but according to Gods determinate Counsell (but not from his Anger) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. God gave leave to Satan that was now in the Serpent when he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> to go into the Scribes and Pharisees, to accuse and condemn the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a wicked Malefactor: But in Gods intent, all that Satan and his instruments did, was but to try the obedience of the Mediator, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 5.8. or els to prove the verity of his human nature, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>These things are of high and necessary consequence to be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this means we shall attain to the right understanding of the meritorious price of our Redemption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this means sundry Scriptures will be cleared from wrong interpretations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this means divers substantiall points of Divinity will be cleared from severall grosse mistakes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By this means several stumbling blocks of offence wil be taken away, first from the Papists, and secondly from the poore Jews.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Papists, for they (especially the malicious Jesuites) do often upbraid us for ascribing unto Christ such passions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of soul from the sense of his Fathers wrath, as cannot be (say they, and I think truly) without sin: <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
<pb facs="tcp:117340:3"/> doth often deride us with great scorn and disdain, for ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing unto Christ such perturbations of soul as did arise from the sense of Gods wrath: and the Rhemists in their Annotations upon the New-Testament do the like in severall places.</p>
            <p>And yet they do also greatly misse of the right understanding of the meritorious price of our Redemption▪ For 1. they joyn their own merits with the merits of Christ, as necessary to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of their Redemption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They do most superstitiously look at the grosse substance of Christs flesh and blood, and at his bodily pains and stripes which he suffered from Satan and his instruments as a Malefactor, as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious price of their Redemption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They do most grossely hold that the soul of Christ went down into the lowest hell to perfect their Redemption, for they make four hells, or four stories in hell: In the first of which they place the souls of all the holy men that died before the coming of Christ: In the second they place the souls of all those children that die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptism: In the third they place the souls of all those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the pains of Purgatory, and in the fourth hell, which is the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all, they place the souls of the damned; and then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this question, Into which of these places did the soule of Christ descend after his death? They answer thus, That Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into all these parts of hell to triumph over Satan, and to deliver the souls of the Fathers, and to comfort others as their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate and Redeemer: see <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Christian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But in all these tenents of theirs, they misse most grossely of the true meritorious price of their Redemption; for they do never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate wherein the efficacy of his mediatoriall sacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth lie: they never shew how his death was a mediatoriall death, by the actuall and joynt concurrence of both his natures, which mediatoriall death of his must be considered as the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cause of his Fathers Attonement, for our full Redemption, Justification, and Adoption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the like need to clear the meritorious price of our Redemption, for the poor Jews sake: For, as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> doth often affirm, they do greatly stumble at these two positions of ours; first in that we do make Christ to stand before God as a guilty sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by his imputing all our sins to him; and secondly they stumble at this, in that we do make the Messiah to redeem us from the curse of the Law, by bearing the said curse for us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:117340:4"/>
            <p>But the Ebrew Doctors do in a jesting and scoffing manner say unto us, <hi>That every Fox shall pay his own skin to the Flayer:</hi> See <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ems</hi> on the Jew, <hi>p.</hi> 318. and yet woe and alas! the poor Jews are lamentably blinded about the meritorious price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though som of the Ebrew Doctors have affirmed, that the Messiah should suffer death for their Redemption, and that his sufferings should be marvellous great, yet I cannot perceive that they do look upon the death of Christ in a right construction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not look upon it as a mediatoriall death actuated by his own power, even by the joynt concurrence of both his natures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The most of the Jews (except a few) do hold that the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah shall never suffer any kind of death at all: The Jews in generall were once perswaded for a time, that one <hi>Rabbi Akibah</hi> was the King Christ: yea both himself, and all the wise men of that age thought he had been Christ the King untill he was killed for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities, and when he was kil'd, then they knew he was not so. See <hi>Ains.</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.19. By this testimony of theirs it is evident that the Jews in generall did hold that their Messiah should never die at all: and in our Saviours daies, when he told the Jews that he must be put to death, <hi>and that the hour was come in which the Son of Man should be glorified,</hi> John. 12.23, 32. then the Jews did stumble at this Doctrine, and said, <hi>We have heard out of the Law that Christ abideth for ever, How then sayest thou that the Son of Man must be lifted up?</hi> v. 34. From hence it is evident, that the Jews in generall did hold that the Messiah should not redeem his people by suffering any kind of death at all: but their common tenent was, that the Messiah should redeem them from the Nations of the world by outward power, as a stately King and Conqueror, and in this carnall sense, they did ordinarily understand that spirituall promise made unto <hi>David,</hi> in 2 Sam. 7.13. <hi>I will establish the Throne of his Kingdom for ever.</hi> This eternall Throne the Jewes (except a few) do understand it of the outward pompous Kingdom of the Messiah; yea the very Apostles themselves for a good while together, understood not the spirituall nature of the Kingdome of the Messiah, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore it follows from the premises; that the Jews as long as they are ignorant of the spirituall nature of the Kingdome of Christ, cannot understand the true meritorious price of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb facs="tcp:117340:4"/> for the Messiah must break the Devills headplot, not by his outward power as a stately King and Conqueror, but by his mediatoriall sacrifice of Attonement.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the poor Jews sakes, we ought as much as may be to clear up the true meritorious price of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did not differ from the Scribes, but in two points mainly; the first was concerning the death of Christ; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was concerning his Resurrection: See <hi>Acts</hi> 17.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. and according to those tenents, <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching had a differing effect upon the Jews in their Synagogues: some were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching to imbrace those tenents, but others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and raised up persecution against him for this Doctrine: and in his Epistle to the <hi>Ebrews</hi> in generall, he doth labour might and main to prove that Christ was God, and that in his human nature he was to die to make his soul a sacrifice of Attonement by the power of his divine nature; that so through death, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In like sort when <hi>Stephen</hi> was convented before the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Jerusalem, he affirm'd before them all that he did then see Jesus Christ whom they had crucified, now living and sitting at the right hand of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.56. But the Judges of the great Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin stopped their ears at this Doctrine of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon multitude did so detest this Doctrine of his death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that in a confused uproar and rage they took him from the Councell and stoned him to death.</p>
            <p>Hence it is evident that the Jews in generall did hold, that the Messiah should neither die nor rise again by the power of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature: and they do also greatly stumble at our common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Imputation, because by it we make the Messiah more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God (in their apprehensions) then any leper can be to us.</p>
            <p>But ah and alas! as the poor Jews will not acknowledge that their Messiah must die, to make his soul a mediatoriall sacrifice of Attonement for their Redemption.</p>
            <p>So many of them are so far blinded by Satan, that they deny his divine nature, and so in effect they deny him to be a Mediator: The Lord in mercy open their eyes to see him whom they have crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (not only as a base malefactor, but) as an obedient Mediator, with mourning and and bleeding hearts: and the Lord in mercy help us to remove all errors from our Doctrine, and to make the path of our Religion plain before them. <hi>Amen,</hi> even so, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>This Argument was thus framed by M. <hi>Henry Smith</hi> a godly Preacher, neer thirty yeers since, in my presence.</head>
            <p>THat which the Scripture doth no where affirm, Christ to have suffered for our redemption, That Christ hath not suffered.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture doth no where affirm that Christ hath suffered the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrath of God for our redemption:</p>
            <p>Therefore Christ hath not suffered the infinite wrath of God for our redemption.</p>
            <p>The Proposition I take for granted, because every article of our faith is set down in the Scripture, and what ever is not proved by Scripture I am not bound to believe.</p>
            <p>The Assumption is thus proved.</p>
            <p>If the Scripture doth any where affirm that Christ hath suffered the infinite wrath of God for our redemption, then it doth affirm it in some of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are chiefly-alledged by Divines for that purpose; as in <hi>Esa. 53.6. Gal. 3.13. 2 Cor. 5.21. Psal. 22.1. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Scripture doth not affirm it in any of those places:</p>
            <p>Therefore it doth no where affirm it.</p>
            <p>Your first place is <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.6. whence the conclusion must be this.</p>
            <p>He that had the iniquity of us all laid upon him, did suffer the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>But Christ had the iniquity of us all laid upon him:</p>
            <p>Therefore Christ did suffer the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>I answer by denying your Proposition, which must be well proved before I can assent to the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>Your second place is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. whence the conclusion must be this.</p>
            <p>He that was made a curse for us, suffered the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>Christ was made a curse for us:</p>
            <p>Therefore Christ did suffer the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>I answer by denying your Proposition as abovesaid.</p>
            <p>Your third place is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. whence the Conclusion must be this.</p>
            <p>He that was made sin for us did suffer the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>Christ was made sin for us:</p>
            <p>Therefore Christ did suffer the infinite wrath of God.</p>
            <p>I answer by denying your Proposition: And so I shall deny your Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the other places.</p>

                     <hi>If I be not mistaken, you hold that Christ did not Redeem us by his sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Divine,</speaker>
                  <p>This word Suffering is a doubtful term, because you do not explain your meaning; and therefore before that you and I do proceed any further, we must explain one anothers meaning, for it is needful in all Controversies, that each side should know what each other do grant, and what they hold differing: Therefore in the first place before we proceed any further, I will tell you what I hold touching the meritorious price of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The point in Controversie about Christs Sufferings, stated.</note>First, I hold that Jesus Christ our Mediator did pay the full price of our Redemption to his Father by the merit of his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Obedience, which (according to Gods determinate Counsel) was tryed through sufferings, inflicted upon his body as upon a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, by Sathan and his Instruments.</p>
                  <p>I put as much weight, virtue, and efficacy in Christs Mediatorial Obedience so tryed, as they do that plead most for our Redemption by his suffering of Gods wrath for us.</p>
                  <p>They place the price of our Redemption in his suffering of Gods wrath for us in full weight and measure, as it is due to our sins by the curse of the Law.</p>
                  <p>I place the price of our Redemption in the merit of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Obedience, whereof his Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement was the Master-piece.</p>
                  <p>I agree with others in this, that Divine wrath is fully satisfied for the sins of all the Elect by the merit of Christs Mediatorial Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I differ from others in this, namely, in the manner of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I say, That Christ did not satisfie Gods wrath for our sins by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the extremity of his Wrath, neither did he suffer the torments of hell neither in his body, nor in his soul, nor any degree of Gods wrath at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though I say that Christ did not suffer his Fathers Wrath, neither in whole, nor in part, yet I affirm that he suffered all things that his Father did appoint him to suffer, in all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, just according to the predictions of all the Prophets, even to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117340:8"/> nodding of the head, and the spitting in the face, as these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do testifie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Peter</hi> told the Jews, <hi>That they had killed the Prince of Life, as God before had shewed by the mouth of all his Prophets; That Christ should suffer, and he fulfilled it:</hi> So <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ did expresly tell his Disciples, That <hi>he must go to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and suffer many things of the Elders, and chief Priests, and Scribes, and be killed, and raised again the third day,</hi> Mat. 16.21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After his Resurrection, he said to the two Disciples, <hi>O Fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken; ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter in his Glory? Luke</hi> 24.25, 26. and in <hi>verse</hi> 44, and 46, he said thus to all his Disciples; <hi>These are the words which I spake unto you, That all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead on the third day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Paul</hi> told the men of <hi>Antioch, That the Rulers of the Jews condemned him, because they knew not the voices of the Prophets concerning him;</hi> and therefore, <hi>though they found no cause of death in him, they desired</hi> Pilate <hi>that he should be slain: and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the Tree, and laid him in a Sepulcher:</hi> Acts 13.27, 28, 29. Mark the phrase, <hi>They fulfilled All things that were written of him:</hi> If they fulfilled all his sufferings, then it was not Gods wrath, but mans wrath that he suffered.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord told <hi>Adam,</hi> not only that the Promised Seed should break the Divels Head-plot, but also that the Divel should crucifie him, and pierce him in the Foot-soals; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The Divel did it by his Instruments, the Scribes and Pharises, by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Roman Souldiers.</p>

                  <p>Therefore those Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117340:9"/> the Curse of the Law, the Torments of Hell, the pains of the Damned, the second Death, and many such like, to redeem us from them.</p>
                  <p>These terms I reject, as not agreeable to the Divine Melody of the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly told you what I affirm, and what I deny; now therefore I pray you to produce your Arguments and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against me: I desire to see how you can prove that Christ did suffer the Wrath of God for our Redemption.</p>

                  <speaker>Divine,</speaker>
                  <p>Your Exposition of this Text is true in part, but in part I dislike it; You say well that the term <hi>Thou,</hi> is <hi>thou</hi> in thine own Person, and <hi>thou</hi> in thy Posterity; thus far I approve of your exposition: But whereas you extend the term <hi>Thou</hi> unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, this last clause I dislike, for the Death and Curse here threatned, cannot extend it self unto the Redeemer in the manner of his working out our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>This Text doth not comprehend <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of it: for 1. This Text is a part of that Covenant only that God made with <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity; respecting the keeping
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117340:9"/> or losing of that happiness which they had by Creation. This Text doth not comprehend wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hin the compasse of it any part of that Covevant which God made with the Mediator, respecting mans Redemption: they are two differing Covenants, and both of them cannot be contained within the compasse of this Text. Any man may say from this Text, That God doth herein declare unto <hi>Adam</hi> the rule of his justice upon him and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in case he disobeyed, by ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing the forbidden fruit, they must certainly dy the death. But none can truly gather from this Text, what was the rule of his justice and mercy in mans Redemption by Christ: this must be fetched from some other Scriptures: but either from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. or from the like Scriptures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this Text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. doth not tell us that Christ should redeem us, in the day that <hi>Adam</hi> should dy: the Redeemer, and the way of Redemption, was wholy hid from <hi>Adam</hi> for that present.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the death here threatned do concern <hi>Adam</hi> only and his posterity, (with whom the Covenant for life or death was made, in case he did eat of the forbidden fruit) then it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Christ, because he is not to be held as one of the fallen sons of <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie; for he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and not by natural generation, as all the fallen sons and daughters of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> are: therefore the Mediator cannot be included within this death here threatned to fallen <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God laid down this rule of his justice to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the time of his innocency, before he had any need of the knowledge of the Mediator: therefore why should the Mediator be comprehended within this term <hi>Thou,</hi> or any thing of mans Redemption by Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The nature of the cursed death here threatned, is such, that it is altogether unpossible that the Mediator could suffer it for our Redemption, and therefore the Mediator cannot possibly be included within this word <hi>[Thou]</hi> in this Text?</p>

                     <hi>If you can make it appear by good consequence, that the Mediator could not suffer that kind of cursed death that is here threatned in this Text, then I shall easily acknowledge that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is not sound: therefore I pray you let me hear your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it was not possible for the Mediator to suffer the said cursed death for our Redemption.</hi>

                  <p>For your better understanding of the true nature of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117340:10"/> death that is here threatned, I will observe two things,</p>
                  <p>First, I will explain unto you what kind of cursed death it is, that of necessity must primarily be meant in this Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will branch out this cursed death in all the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; and then I will apply all to Christ: by which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication you may the better be able to discern whether Christ could suffer the cursed death that is meant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. or No.</p>
                  <p>First, I will explain unto you the particular kind of cursed death that God threatned to fall upon <hi>Adam,</hi> as soon as he had eaten the forbidden fruit; and that must be understood of a Spiritual death principally; for the curse runs thus, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dy the death.</hi> That is to say in the very self same natural day, in which thou dost eat of the forbidden fruit, in dying thou shalt dy: and what death else can it be that fell upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the very same natural day in which he eat the forbidden fruit, but a Spiritual death? it cannot be understood of the death of <hi>Adams</hi> body, for his body lived nine hundred and thirty years after this day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.5. besides, the death of <hi>Adams</hi> body was threatned to fall upon him after this day, (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.) either as another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct curse, or else as a branch of the former death which might be repented after his fall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither can the death here threatned be understood primarily of eternal death in Hell, as you would have it; for that death cannot fal upon any man til after this life is ended: that death doth not agree to the circumstance of time expressed in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The cursed death that fell upon <hi>Adam</hi> for his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient eating, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily of the spiritual death of his pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful qualities.</note>Thirdly, Therefore it follows, that the kind of death that was threatned to fall upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the very self same natural day in which he did eat the forbidden fruit, must be understood primarily of a Spiritual death, or of the death of his pure nature in corruption and sin.</p>
                  <p>At the first, <hi>Adam</hi> was created after Gods image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. full of natural puritie and uprightness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24. which would have kept his body alive and in Gods favour for ever, if he had not eaten of the forbidden fruit; but as soon as ever he had but eaten of the forbidden fruit, he became dead in corruption and sin, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2. and then it might be said of <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of his eating, as it was said of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Thou hast a Name that thou livest, but thou art dead, Rev.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Adam was still alive corporally, but he was dead spiritually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:117340:10"/>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Calvine</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. demandeth what kind of death it was that God threatned to fall upon <hi>Adam</hi> in this Text: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to this purpose: <hi>It seemeth to me</hi> (saith he) <hi>that we must fetch the definition thereof from the contrary: Consider</hi> (saith he) <hi>from what life</hi> Adam <hi>fell; At the first</hi> (saith he) <hi>he was created in every part of his body and soul with pure qualities, after the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God: therefore on the contrary</hi> (saith he) <hi>by dying the death, is meant, that he should be emptied of all the image of God, and possessed with corrupt qualities, as soon as ever he did but eat of the forbidden fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, by the judgement of Mr <hi>Calvin,</hi> the death that fell upon <hi>Adam,</hi> in the day of his disobedient eating, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the spiritual death of <hi>Adams</hi> pure nature in corrupt and sinful qualities: and none of <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie that are begotten by natural generation can be exempted from this spiritual death, no not the very Elect, they are dead in corruption and sin, as well the Reprobates, as soon as ever they have life in the Womb.</p>
                  <p>And it is further evident by certain other circumstances that did befall <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of his transgression, that the kind of death which was threatned to fall upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the very day of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient eating must needs be understood of a spiritual death primarily.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was ashamed. 2. He was afraid. And 3. He did hide himself from Gods presence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>First, He was ashamed. Because he was now stripped naked of Gods image, for he was now deprived of his pure qualities which he had by Creation, and instead thereof he was now posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with other shameful and corrupt qualities, both in his body and in his soul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He was afraid of Gods wrath, for now the terrors of a guilty conscience fell upon him, for his sinful eating.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He did now hide himself from God, because he did now find himself to be out of Gods favour, until it pleased God of his free grace to renew his favour towards him, by the free promise of a mediator, to break the Devils head-plot by his mediatorial Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Atonement, thereby procuring Gods Atonement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For as by one man sin entered into the world,</hi> (namely the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-sin, by <hi>Adams</hi> sinful eating) <hi>and death by sin,</hi> So (a spiritual)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117340:11"/> death passed over all men, in whom (that is to say, in whose loyns all men have sinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and that <hi>Adam</hi> by his one sin in eating the forbidden fruit, procured not only his own spiritual death; but also he did thereby procure an Hereditary sinful nature to all his posterity, and that corruption of our nature is now called The Law of death, and the body of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. because it fell upon <hi>Adam</hi> and his posteritie for his transgressing of the first law of prohibition, by his bodily eating of the forbidden fruit: and in this respect also the Apostles are said to preach to the dead in sin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>So then, from all the premises I may well conclude, that the kind of death which God threatned to execute upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the very day of his sinful eating, was a spiritual death, or it may be called the death of his pure nature in corruption and sin; and this Spiritual death may well be called <hi>The first death,</hi> or the original death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the original cause of all other deaths and curses whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and truly unlesse we can get into the Mediator by Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our souls be separated from our bodies, this first death will bring us unto the second death at last.</p>
                  <p>This exposition of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. I conceive to be full, fair and clear: Secondly, I come now in the next place (according to my promise) to apply this cursed Spiritual death together, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cursed deaths unto Christ, that so you may thereby the better see whether it be not altogether unpossible for our Mediator to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the said Curses of the Law in our stead for our Redemption there-from or no.</p>
                  <p>First, Did Christ suffer the curse of the first spiritual death that was threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sinful eating of the forbidden fruit; then truly he was dead in corruption and sin, as <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity were? This is a blasphemous inference, (and yet you cannot avoid it by the common doctrine of imputation) but the Holy Scriptures do often testifie that Christ was pure in nature, and without the least tincture of sin, either in his corruption or life. He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, without sin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. and all his life long, there was no sin found in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. Ioh. 8.46. therefore seeing he was altogether sinless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, both in nature and life, it was altogether unpossible for him to suffer that kind of cursed death that was threatned to fall upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117340:11"/> day of his sinful eating; and therefore it follows by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that he not did redeem us from that cursed death, by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that cursed death in our stead. 2. Hence it follows also by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence, that God the Father hath found out some other way where by he takes satisfaction for the sins of all the Elect, and not by inflicting this cursed spiritual death upon our Mediator for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there be good and necessary Reason (as there is) to exempt our Mediator from suffering the first cursed Spiritual death: Then there is as good reason to exempt him also from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any other curse of the Law whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Examine the Particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, Consider the first degree of our bodily death, and that is Diseases, and deadly dangers, which God doth usually inflict upon the fallen sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> for sin: Did Christ bear these diseases and bodily infirmities, upon his own body, to redeem us from them? By the common Doctrine of Imputation you must affirm it; and yet many absurd consequences will follow, if it be affirmed, as plain experience doth shew us: for when Christ healed all that were sick of sundry kinds of infirmities, he did not take their diseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and lay them upon his own body; he did not take the leprosie from the Lepers, and lay it upon his own Body: he did not take the unclean spirits from them that were possessed, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Body; but he bare them; that is to say, he bare them away from the sick, by the power of his Godhead, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Esai</hi> 53.4. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another curse of the Law which all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam</hi> do ly under, is Death natural. Now consider, Whether did Christ suffer this bodily death in our stead, to redeem our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or No? I say No, it is a grosse conceit to think so: and though the Apostle doth say, that God appointed Christ to dy once, as he <hi>appointed all men once to dy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The death of Christ was of a far differing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the death of all the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27, 28. yet the Apostle doth not mean that God appointed Christ to dy such a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death as he hath appointed to all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam:</hi> there is a wide difference: for God hath appointed all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> to dy once, by the justice of that curse that was laid upon <hi>Adam</hi> for sin; so that they cannot by their natural power withstand it: But the death of Christ was not inflicted upon him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117340:12"/> by the justice of that curse, as I have opened the matter in <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.15. because he dyed not as a fallen son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but voluntarily as a Mediator, for he had a power in nature to withstand it, and therefore his death was not a forced passive death, but a voluntary Mediatorial death, according to his own voluntary Covenant with his Father, for Mans Redemption. I grant notwithstanding, that Christ was a Patient aswell as an Agent, in his death; because he suffered many wounds in his Body, from the violence of Tyrants, by means whereof he shed much blood; but yet for all that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of those wounds, I mean his Soul was not separated from his Body by the violence of those wounds, as the Souls of the two Theeves were that were crucified with him: for our Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his sufferings told his Disciples That no man could take away his life from him, till himself pleased to lay it down, by his own will, desire and power, according as he had covenanted with his Father. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>And it is farther evident, that the manner of Christs death was far differing from that kind of natural death that God hath inflicted as a curse upon all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> because none of the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> have any power in nature to withstand the power of death; much lesse have they any power in nature to raise up their dead bodies again after death: But our blessed Mediator had a power in himself, not only to lay down his life when he pleased; but he had a power also in himself to take it up again, when he pleased, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. Therefore I may well conclude, that the death of Christ was far different from the death of all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore he did not redeem us from the curse of our bodily death, by bearing it in our stead.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is another curse annexed to the death of our bodies, and that is the putrifaction of our bodies after death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return:</hi> this Text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies both the death of the body by sicknesse, and the putrifaction of the body also after death.<note place="margin">The body of Christ after death could not see corruption in his grave, because his Godhead did still reside both in his dead body, and in his departed Soul.</note> Now examine whether Christ did redeem us from this particular curse by bearing it in our stead? The Apostle denies it in plain words, saying, <hi>Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy one to see corruption. Act.</hi> 2.27. in this Text there is a reason given, why the body of Christ could not see corruption, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Soul was separated from it; namely, because it was the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117340:12"/> Habitation of his Godhead; but our sinful bodies after the Soul is departed, are but a corrupt masse of putrified earth; and therefore immediately after our Souls are departed, our bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to purge and putrifie; but the body of Christ had his Divine nature in it, when his Soul was separated from it: for his body had its subsistance, not only from his Soul (as our sinful bodies have from our Souls) but from his Godhead also: yea not only his dead body, but his Soul also, after it was separated from his body, had their subsistance and dependance on his Godhead, by vertue of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal union. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Yea his Godhead did still reside substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or essentially in his dead body, when it was in his grave, as well as in his Soul, when it was in Paradise.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I may well conclude, that it was not possible for the Mediator to suffer this cursed p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ece of death for us, without destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his personal union: for if his body had seen corruption, it could not have been called the Holy one of God, that could see no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is yet another cursed death, which all the fallen sons of <hi>Adam</hi> are subject to by nature, and that is death eternal; this <hi>Death is the wages of Sin,</hi> as well as the rest, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.26. and this death is called <hi>the second death,</hi> because it is never executed upon any, till after this life is ended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. Now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether did Christ redeem us from this cursed death, by suffering the same for us, or No? I say No: and my Reasons are these,</p>
                  <p>First, If he had redeemed us from this cursed death, by suffering the same for us; then by the same reason he must have suffered all the other curses of the Law, to redeem us from them, as well as from this cursed death: but I have shewed an utter impossibility for that, immediately before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Christ hath redeemed us from death eternal, by suffering the said death for us, then he did descend locally into the very place of Hell it self, to suffer it there; for no man can suffer death eternal in this life: no man can suffer the second death till after this life is ended. All the deaths that the fallen sons of <hi>Adam</hi> do suffer in this life, being put together, may be called the first death, because they are inflicted upon mens souls and bodies in this life; but death eternal is not inflicted upon mens souls and bodies
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117340:13"/> till after this life is ended; and therefore it is fitly called the second death: and therefore our Saviour could not suffer it while he was alive, neither in the Garden, nor upon the Crosse.</p>

                     <hi>I confesse, as you have opened the first cursed death, in</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>both in the root and in the branches thereof, I dare not maintain what I have formerly affirmed: and yet I am not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the point in question: Therefore I pray give me leave to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Reasons and Arguments which I find cited by sundry learned men, to prove that Christ did redeem us by suffering the curse of the Law for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Learned Divines affirm that Christ hath born the curse of the Law two manner of ways, for our Redemption.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First, (say they) He bare the guilt of our sins, both original and actual, by Gods imputation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, They say also, that he bare the wrath of God in due proportion to the curse of the Law, not by imputation only, but really in our stead, for our freedom and redemption therefrom. And these assertions they prove from several Scriptures, and especially from Gods definitive sentence, in</hi> Gen. 2.17.</p>

                  <p>I pray let me see how you can infer from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. that Christ did bear <hi>Adams</hi> sin by imputation; and his cursed death really: and before you go about to make your inference, consider advisedly, 1. What <hi>Adams</hi> sin was. And 2. What was the true nature of that cursed death that was inflicted upon him for his sin, and then I beleeve you will soon see into what grosse absurdities the common doctrine of Imputation will lead you.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, Consider <hi>Adams</hi> sin, what it was, and you will find it to be his disobedient eating of the forbidden fruit, contrary to Gods expresse prohibition, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider also what was the true nature of that cursed death that was inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> for his sinfull eating, and that was the present Spiritual death of his pure nature, in corruption and sin; if so, then you may well tremble at the inference: for if Christ bare <hi>Adams</hi> sin, by Gods imputation and his curse really, then you make Christ to bear his Spiritual curse, and then you make him to be dead in corruption and sin, and then he had more need to get a Mediator to save him, then to be a Mediator to save others. Such wofull inferences as this will often follow upon the common Doctrine of Imputation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is strange to me that you should deny the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine of Imputation: I pray let me see what other grounds you have against it, besides the former inference.</hi>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Divine.</speaker>
                  <p>I have divers other Reasons against it, and I suppose more then I can think on at this time. First, Consider the true force of the word impute, in the natural signification thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> God cannot in Iustice impute our sins to our innocent Saviour</note> and then I beleeve you will acknowledge that it cannot stand with the justice of God to impute our sins to our innocent Saviour. For,</p>
                  <p>To impute sin to any, is to account them for guilty sinners: and to impute the guilt of other mens sins to any, is to account them guilty of other mens sins by participation: but in case there be no participation with other men in their sins, then it cannot stand with justice to impute other mens sins to them. <hi>Shimei</hi> said thus unto <hi>David, Let not my Lord impute iniquitie unto me, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I did perversly.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. By this speech of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> it is evident, that to impute sin to any, is to charge them with sin, and to remember it, and to reckon it up against them: but many times men do unjustly impute sin to others, either upon bare surmises, or out of a malicious intent against them: but God is the righteous Judge of all the world, therefore he cannot chuse but do right, when he doth impute sin to any, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>We are sure</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that the judgement of God is according to Truth. Rom.</hi> 2.2. He doth never impute sin to any, but according to the exact rule of Justice, reckoning up and remembring both the number and the nature of every sin: if he impute blood to any, he doth it upon certain grounds of knowledge and truth; therefore that man shall certainly be cut off, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not to impute sin to any, is to acquit them from the guilt of Sin, as <hi>Shimeis</hi> speech to <hi>David</hi> doth declare, <hi>Let not my Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>impute iniquitie to me, neither remember that I did perversly.</hi> By this speech he intreated <hi>David</hi> to forgive his sin, and to blot it out of his remembrance, and so consequently to make him sinlesse, by his Atonement and forgivenesse: and so <hi>David</hi> doth also explain the matter, saying, <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute sin. Rom.</hi> 4.8. His meaning in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive must needs ly thus, Blessed is the man with whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is reconciled by his merciful pardon and forgivenesse. And thus the Apostle doth also explain the matter, saying, <hi>God was in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117340:14"/> Christ, reconciling the World to himself</hi> (or making Atonement between the World and himself) <hi>not imputing their sins to them.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it follows by necessary consequence, that seeing to impute sin to any, is to make them guilty of sin, God cannot in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice impute our sins to our innocent Saviour, and if he should so do he should be as unjust as the Jews were.</p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>ation.</note>Secondly, If our Mediator had stood as a guilty sinner before God, by his imputing of our sins to him, then he could not have been a fit person in Gods esteem to do the office of a Mediator for our Redemption: who will accept of such a Mediator as he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be vild, by the imputation of sin? Ddoubtlesse if God had but once imputed our sins to Christ, he could not have accepted him as the immaculate Lamb of God, but he would have esteemed him as a Lamb full of blemishes, and then Satan would have found somewhat against him, and have accused him to God, as an unfit person to do the office of a Mediator: but our Saviour doth testifie that Satan could not find any thing against him: and his Father did testifie that he was his welbeloved Son, in whom he was well pleased. Therefore it follows by good consequence, that Christ did not stand as a guilty sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r before God, by his imputing of our sins to him: and therefore it doth also follow by as good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that God could not in justice inflict the curse of the Law upon him for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. God doth still impute our sins to Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as much as ever he did when he was alive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth.</note>Thirdly, I will hereafter shew you when I come to open the Type of the two goats, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. that you may with as good reason affirm that God the Father doth still impute our sins to Christ now he sits at the right hand of God in glory, as affirm that he did impute our sins to him, when he was alive here upon the earth: the one follows from as good consequence from the common Doctrine of Imputation, as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. The Father doth impute our sins to himself, as much as ever he did impute them to Christ.</note>Fourthly, I will also hereafter shew you in opening the Hebrew phrase, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.18. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1. that the Father doth lay all our sins upon himself, by imputation, as much as ever he did lay them upon Christ by imputation: but he doth not lay our sins upon himself by imputation, therefore not upon Christ by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I will also hereafter shew you in opening the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117340:14"/> phrase in <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10. that Christ did make his own Soul a trespasse or a guilt, by imputing all our Trespasses to himself,<note place="margin">5. Christ did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all our sins to himself, as much as ever the Father did.</note> as much as ever the Father made him a Trespasse, by imputing all our trespasses to him: and that Christ made himself sin, as much as ever the Father made him sin: for he finished trespasse, and ended sin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The common Doctrine of imputation, is I know not what kind of imputation; it is such a strange kind of imputation that it differs from all the several sorts of imputing sin to any that ever I can meet with all in all the Scripture, and therefore it may well be suspected to be but a device of Satan, to darken the truth of the most needful doctrine of a Sinners justification.</p>
                  <p>First, I find that man doth impute sin to man, sometimes justly,<note place="margin">6. Gods imputing of sin to an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld kind of imputation, and therefore it may well be suspected to be but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main invention.</note> and sometimes unjustly; but alwaies with an intent to make such persons to be guilty of sin. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Jews and Romans did impute sin to Christ, upon pretended grounds of guiltinesse, and thereupon they did punish him really, as a guilty malefactor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth impute sin to man, but he doth ever do it upon certain grounds of guiltinesse: I cannot find that ever God did impute sin to an innocent; such a Tenent hath been gathered from certain figurative expressions of Scripture, by some Godly learned, but upon due search, I find they are deceaved, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Godly persons have been deceaved by them, because they have taken such expositions upon trust from them: But it is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the mind of God that every Godly Christian should with their own eys search into the true scope of those figurative expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: It is the duty of every wise Christian to search out the mistical sense of such like phrases, as well as the literal; then they might soon have seen how such phrases have been wrested, to maintain an old received Error, which God never intended, by such figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expressions. If those figurative phrases had been well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at the first, doubtlesse the doctrine of Gods imputing our sins to Christ had never been broached. Take heed therefore how you do father such a kind of imputation upon God the Father, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mediator, as he never exercised towards any other man, lest he impute sin to you for it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The term of Bearing sin and sorrows, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers senses in Scripture.</note>The coherence of <hi>Matthew</hi> in opening this place of <hi>Esai,</hi> lies thus: After that Iesus had cured <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother of her Fever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.14. then in <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>they brought unto him many that were possessed with Devils; and he cast out the spirits with his Word; and healed all that were sick: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet: He took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christ bare our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities when he bare away our diseases by his divine Power.</note> But here it may be considered how Christ did bear our infirmities and sicknesses; whether did he take them from the sick, and lay them upon his own body, or how did he bear them? The answer is, that he did not bear them from the sick, as a Porter bears a burden, by laying them upon his own body, but he bare them away from the sick, by his divine Power, in curing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. And this action of Christ is alledged by <hi>Matthew,</hi> as a proof of the Divine nature, dwelling in the humain nature of Christ: for in asmuch as he was able to bear away their sorrows and diseases by a word speaking,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Iacob</hi> was much to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Therefore though your Author make such a great florish about the signification of the Hebrew word, as if he saw further into the meaning of it than the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> did, affirming that Christ bare our iniquities by imputation, and our sorrows (namely Hell sorrows) * really, yet it is evident that he doth grosly mistake the meaning of the Ho y Ghost, if <hi>Matthews</hi> exposition be of any

                  <p>Although your Author doth translate the Hebrew word in <hi>Esay,</hi> by the word Iniquities, yet the Holy Ghost by the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> doth translate it Infirmities; and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned men do also translate it Infirmities, Maladies, Diseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp;c. But what need is there to alledge the testimony of learned Translators, seeing the Holy Ghost in <hi>Matthew</hi> doth so translate it to our hands: and truly me thinks your Author should not be more learned than the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>I grant notwithstanding, that the word in <hi>Esay,</hi> doth signifie Iniquities, as your Author doth translate it; but yet the sense of the word must not be wrested, to maintain the common doctrine of Imputation, as your Author doth intend it: but in this place the word Iniquities must be taken figuratively, for the punishment of our Iniquities, by infirmities and sicknesses; and so <hi>Matthew</hi> doth expresse the meaning to be: and so <hi>Iob</hi> doth open the Hebrew word to mean, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14.

                     <hi>Sir it seemeth strange to me that you should make</hi> Esay <hi>to speak nothing at all, neither of Christ bearing our iniquites by Gods imputation, nor of his bearing our sorrows, from the wrath of God really; seeing it is not my Author alone, but sundry other learned Divines, that do so expound this Text. But I desire you for my better satisfaction, to make your exposition good from the coherence.</hi>

                  <p>I will endeavour to satisfie your desire: The coherence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117340:16"/> of this Text must be fetched from chap. 52.13. as <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth well observe: There the Prophet speaks of the most excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Mediator, which he should most wisely and prudently accomplish for our Redemption: then in chap. 53. he begins to tell us, that the knowledge thereof shall be published abroad in the world, by the report of the Gospel: but in <hi>vers.</hi> 1. the Prophet breaks out into admiration, at the strange unbeleef of most of the Jews that would not imbrace the report of this glad tydings: and thereupon the Prophet doth enquire into the reason of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef: and the first reason was, because they held the person of the mediator to be but basely descended, <hi>verse</hi> 1.2. they held him to be no better than a bare and base man; without any such form or beauty as they expected should be in their Messiah: for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that their Messiah should come among them, like a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conquering King; and therefore because his birth, breeding, and parentage, was so poor and obscure, they despised him as a poor shoot from a dry decayed stock: and in this respect the Jews said in scorn, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter? Mark</hi> 6.3. and <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son? Mat.</hi> 13.55. and in scorn they said, that they knew not whence he was; <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.24. and in scorn they asked him where he had his Learning? <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.15. In these and such like respects, they were ashamed to acknowledge him to be their Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; and therefore they refused to beleeve on him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.37.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, if their eys had been in their heads, they might have seen that he was descended of the right Kingly line of <hi>David,</hi> and that he was the next apparent heir to the Crown, if Tyrants had given him his right, according to the common Law of Nations, as it is evident by his Genealogy from <hi>Ioseph</hi> his reputed Father, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. and by his mother <hi>Maries</hi> Genealogie, in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. But at this time his parents durst not openly manifest their Kingly right, for fear of Tyrants, they kept their descent only in private records, for the latter part of their Genealogie, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. is not cited from the publick Scripture Records, as the first part is: and in this regard Christs parents might well say to their faithful friends and kindreds, as it is said in <hi>Esai</hi> 3.7. <hi>Make me no Prince of the People, for there is no bread nor clothing in my house:</hi> for now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Tabernacle or Family of <hi>David</hi> was fallen into decay, as <hi>Amos</hi> foretold it should (<hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.) Therefore seeing there was no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117340:16"/> outward form of Kingly Majesty in him, (as they expected should be in their Messiah) they set him at naught.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it was now high time for the Prophet to shew forth the true worth and dignity of his person, in this fourth verse; not from his Kingly descent, from <hi>Davids</hi> loyns, but from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his Godhead, which he did cleerly manifest unto them, by bearing away their infirmities from them, which God had inflicted on them for their iniquities. So then, the first part of this verse, (I mean so much as you have cited) speaks nothing at all of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ; much lesse of his sufferings from Gods wrath. But yet the latter part of this fourth verse doth speak of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, though nothing at all of his sufferings from Gods wrath for our sins. The last clause of this fourth verse runs thus, <hi>yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</hi> That is to say, though the glory of his Godhead did shine in our eys, by his miraculous cures, yet we in our posteritie, (the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees) did esteem him no better than a grosse Impostor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we put him to death, as a vild malefactor; and then we judged him to be smitten and stricken of God, for his deserved faults. And this interpretation is further confirmed by the next verse.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I must needs acknowledge that you have given me good satisfaction in the interpretation of this fourth verse: but yet I am not satisfied in the point in question: therefore I will propound the next verse also, to your consideration. The text runs thus, in</hi> Esa. 53.5. <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his stripes we are healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From this Text sundry learned Divines do conclude, that Christ was wounded and bruised with the wrath of God, for our sins.</hi>

                  <p>These words (I confesse) do plainly prove, that Christ did bear divers wounds, bruises, and stripes, for our peace and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but yet the text doth not say that he bare these wounds, bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and stripes, from Gods wrath, for our sins, as you would have it.</p>
                  <p>But for your better understanding of the true scope and drift of this Text, I will propound and answer three questions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Who did wound him, and bruise him?</item>
                        <item>2. Where did he bear those wounds, bruises and stripes?</item>
                        <item>3. For what end was he wounded?</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:117340:17"/>1. To the first question, who did wound him, bruise him, and stripe him? The answer is, It was Satan, by his instruments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods prediction, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Thou shalt pierce him in the footsoals: that is to say, Thou Satan shalt put the promised seed to death as a wicked malefactor, by thy instruments, the Scribes, Pharisees, and the Roman Souldiers: thou shalt pierce his hands and feet, by nailing them to the Crosse, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. All this was done according to the determinate councel of God, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect God may be said to wound him; but yet God did not wound him as an angry judge, for our sins, as you would have it; but for the tryal of his Mediatorial obedience; and therefore he is said to learn obedience by the things that he suffered. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second question is this, Where did Christ bear these wounds, bruises, and stripes, whether in his body, or in his Soul, or in both?</p>
                  <p>The answer is, that he bare them in his body only, and not in his Soul: his Soul was not capable of bearing wounds, bruises, and stripes: Satan could not wound his Soul, but yet he did wound his body, by stirring up the wicked Jews and Romans to wound, bruise and stripe him in his Body: and this <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, saying, That <hi>the Iews fulfilled all his sufferings, just as it was foretold by all the Prophets. Act.</hi> 13.27.29. if so, then the wounds, bruises and stripes here spoken of, cannot be understood of inward wounds, bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and stripes, from Gods wrath, for our sins: as you would have it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> doth teach us to expound this Text, of Christs Bodily sufferings only: His words run thus, <hi>He bare our sins in his body on the Tree:</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.) That is to say, He bare our punishments, (for such punishments after the Hebrew phrase are called Sin,) when he suffered as a sinful malefactor, upon the Tree. If <hi>Peters</hi> phrase <hi>(he bare our sins in his Body, on the Tree,)</hi> had meant any thing of his bearing our sins, by Gods imputation, or of his bearing of Gods wrath for our sins; as you would have it; then truly his case of sufferings had not been a sit example to have been applyed to the case of those beleeving servants, that suffered unjust bodily punishments, from their cruel Heathen Masters: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth exhort those beleeving Servants to patient suffering, from the example of Christ, who did no sin, neither was there any guile found in his mouth: and when he suffered, he threatned not,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117340:17"/> but committed his case to him that judgeth righteously. Why did Christ commit his case to him that judgeth righteously? surely, because he suffered unjustly from the hands of wicked men, if he had suffered the wrath of God for our sins; this appeal to God for justice against himself had not bin sutable.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by the judgement of the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> the wounds, bruises, and stripes, which Christ suffered, were not inflicted upon his Soul, from Gods wrath, for our sins; but upon his body only from the unjust wrath of Satan and his instruments.</p>
                  <p>The third question is this: For what end was Christ wounded bruised and striped?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> The end is expressed in the latter part of the Text, by a double phrase. First, It was for the Chastisement of our Peace. And secondly, It was for our healing. Both these phrases are Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonina, and expresse one and the same end of Christs sufferings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, He was wounded by Satan and his instruments; but yet it was done by Gods appointment, as a chastisement upon him, for our Peace: in the matter of his chastisement God aimed at the tryal of his Mediatorial obedience: for Christ learned obedience by that which he suffered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. Secondly, It was for our Peace, for when his Mediatorial oblation was found perfect through tryals; it became the meritorious procuring cause of the Fathers atonement; which was for our peace: he was made perfect (through sufferings) and so he became the Author (or procurer) of eternal salvation to all that obey him, (by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. God appointed Satan by his Instruments, to wound him, bruise him, and stripe him, as a malefactor, and to do his worst, to make him shrink, if he could, from the exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Mediatorial oblation: and in this respect, the Lord delighted to bruise him, and to put him to griefe, when he made his Soul an offering for sin, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10. This was the end of Gods chastisement; but Satans end was quite contrary, for he wounded him to make him grudge at his sufferings, and to make him unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dy, that so he might spoile the perfection of his Mediatorial obedience. The like wicked end he had, in wounding the body of <hi>Iob;</hi> God aimed at the tryal of <hi>Iobs</hi> Faith and patience; but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan aimed to bring him unto a sinful distemper, by his sufferings, that so he might provoke him to curse God; and that thereby he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117340:18"/> might provoke God to punish <hi>Iob</hi> more deeply.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods end in suffering Satan and his instruments to wound and stripe our blessed Mediator, was that by his stripes we might be healed: Stripes properly taken do not heal, but wound the flesh: but as stripes are as a Synecdoche of his sufferings, for the tryal of his Mediatorial obedience; so they have a healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for when God had tryed his obedience, and found it perfect and intire, lacking nothing; then he became the Author, or the Meritorious procuring cause of Gods atonement for our healing; for by his Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement (tryed through suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,) he procured his Fathers Atonement for our pardon, or for our Healing; for pardon and forgivenesse doth heal our sinful Souls; as <hi>David</hi> doth expresse it, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.14. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3. This healing of the Soul is also ascribed to the Mediator, as well as to the Father; namely, as he is the Meritorious procuring cause of the Fathers Atonement; and therefore <hi>Matthew</hi> doth tell us, that Christ did not only heal mens bodies, but forgive sins; <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2.6. and healing in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. is expounded to be forgiving of sins, in <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12. and Christ saith thus to his people, <hi>I am Iehovah, that healeth thee, Exod.</hi> 15.26. and he came to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with healing in his wings: <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.16. <hi>Esai.</hi> 33.24. And thus we are healed by his stripes; namely by the perfection of his Mediatorial obedience, (which was found perfect through sufferings,) he procured his Fathers Atonement for our healing: and thus Christ himself doth open the perfection of his obedience, through sufferings, in <hi>Esai.</hi> 50.5, 6. The Lord hath opened mine Ear (to attend my Fathers will, through all my sufferings and tryals,) And I was not rebellious, nor turned away back (namely, I did not grudge at the sharpnesse, nor at the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of my wounds and stripes,) I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to the nippers, (not only as an outward Patient, but as an inward Agent: I freely gave my self to be tryed by stripes, in all ready obedience to my Fathers will, without the least inward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilingness to have any part of my appointed sufferings abated. Our Saviour did twise give his back to the smiters, 1. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.67. and 2. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.26. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> might if he would, have escaped out of their hands, he had power to do it, but he would not do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he minded not the ease of his flesh, but that he might do his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117340:18"/> Fathers will; for as his Father delighted to break him with stripes, &amp;c. for the tryal of his Mediatorial obedience, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10. so the Son delighted to learn obedience, by that which he suffered; and so being found perfect, (through afflictions) he became the Meritorious Author of eternal Salvation, to all that obey him, by beleeving in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, 9. He gave his back to the smiters, not only as a patient malefactor, but also as an active Mediator; he did in all points order his affections to do Gods will through all his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: and so the healing vertue of his stripes, proceeded not from his bare passive obedience, but from his active Mediatorial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which was wrapped up, and conjoyned with his patient pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive sufferings, as I have expounded the matter more at larg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>But I think it necessary to give you a word of caution more, touching this phrase, <hi>By his stripes we are healed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Christs stripes lies not in his patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: but in his active Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial obedience, which was tryed through stripes and sufferings.</note> Take heed of the error of the Papists, for they do attribute a healing vertue to his bodily stripes inflicted upon him by the Jews, as a patient male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; take heed of this literal sense; for as the flesh of Christ doth not profit us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. so in like sort no outward pain that was inflicted upon his flesh, (simply considered) doth heal our Souls: the healing vertue lies in another ingredient, (which our Saviour did mingle together, with his outward sufferings) and that was his inward active Mediatorial obedience, in doing Gods will in and through all his sufferings: his Godhead did carry on his humain nature, with such an inward active power of obedience, to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, through all his sufferings, that he delighted to give <hi>his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to the nippers;</hi> without the least turning away back, or without any the least natural unwillingnesse to make his oblation: and truly if this ingredient of his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, concurring with his humain natue in the active power of his obedience to his Fathers will had been wanting, all his sufferings (which he suffered as a meer patient) could not have profited us for our Redemption: for no other obedience is Mediatorial for our Redemption, but that which proceeded from the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both his natures: his flesh, or humain actions alone considered, cannot profit us; therefore not his Blood, nor his Crosse, nor his Stripes, can heal us, alone considered; as the blind Papists do superstitiously affirm. They (out of their blind devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117340:19"/> adore these things as the meritorious cause of their salvation; they adore the nails, and the woodden Crosse whereon our Lord was crucified as a malefactor: and they pretend it is out of love to Christ; but they might do well to consider whether it be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a dutiful child to love the knife of the murderer that killed his Father.</p>
                  <p>But I will leave them to their blind devotion, and speak a little more of the healing vertue of his stripes.</p>
                  <p>I hold it necessary often to remember this distinction; namely, that Christ suffered both as a malefactor,<note place="margin">Christ suffered both as a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and as a Mediator, at one and the same time.</note> and as a Mediator, at one and the same time: he did not only patiently suffer others to scourge him, (for many blessed Martyrs have done as much as that) but he did more than patiently suffer; for he delighted to give his back to the smiters, and he delighted to give his Soul to God (in the time of his sufferings) as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his Fathers Atonement to poor sinners, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.18. This kind of obedience I call his Mediatorial obedience: and yet it was performed in the time of his passive obedience: and thus by his Mediatorial obedience through death, and through stripes, he hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>

                     </gap> search out the Godly, whom they count as the cheef of sinners, that they may punish them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117340:19"/> for their supposed iniquities, such as they please to lay to their charge. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Lot</hi> was bidden to fly out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he might not be destroyed in the iniquity or in the punishment of the Citie: And <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons must not omit any of their Priestly garments in the time of their administration, least they bear Iniquity, and dy. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.43. Yea Sin and Iniquitie is frequently put for the outward punishment of sin and iniquitie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Gods justice, or from mans justice, as all these places do witnes, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.17.19, 20. <hi>Num.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. Also in sundry other Scripture the term Sin is put for the punishment of sin, by outward reproaches, wounds, bruises, stripes, and death, which God or man doth inflict upon men for their sins: and in this sense <hi>Peter</hi> means that Christ bare our sins in his Body on the Tree; when he was punished and crucified as a Sinful malefactor.</p>
                  <p>But now seeing I am upon the phrase of Bearing Sin, I will shew you how Christ did bear our sins divers ways, in several senses.</p>
                  <p>First, He bare our sins,<note place="margin">Christ bare our sins sundry kind of ways.</note> and carried our sorrows when he bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our diseases (as they were the effects of sin) by the power of his Godhead; as I have expounded, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ bare our sins, as our Priest and Sacrifice, by making Atonement with his Father, for our sins; as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ bare our sins, as a Porter bears a burden, when he bare our punishments, which we inflicted upon him for sin, in his body on the Tree: as I have exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unded, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.24.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ bare our sins when he did patiently bear our sinful imputations: and this is proved by the complaint of Christ, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable troubles have compassed me about:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sin is often put for false imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sin from wicked men.</note>
                     <hi>my sins have taken such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; they are more in number than the hairs of my head; therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> In these words Christ doth not complain against his Father for his imputing of our sins to him (as the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Imputation doth make the stream of Interpreters to speak for if Christ had but grudged against his Fathers dealing with him,<note place="margin">The holy Chost speaks this Psalm in the person of Christ. See <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in <hi>Gal. 3.13.</hi> and <hi>Ans.</hi> on this Psalm.</note> but in the least measure; he had spoiled the efficacy of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial obedience. These words of Christ are a complaint indeed,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117340:20"/> but he doth not complain against Gods dealing, but against the dealing of the wicked Scribes and Pharisees, because they compasse him about with innumerable false accusations and imputations of sin; so that he was not able to look up, he was not able to justifie himself before <hi>Pilate,</hi> because he was a corrupt Judge, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his false accusers: and this interpretation needs not seem strange to any that do but seriously compare with consideration, <hi>verse</hi> 11. and <hi>verse</hi> 14. with this 12 <hi>verse,</hi> and that do but compare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the manifold tumultuous accusations and imputations of Sin that the generality of the Jews did lay against our Saviour, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pilate,</hi> and before the multitude, at sundry times.</p>
                  <p>The like instance we have in <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.3. where <hi>Divid</hi> doth complain against his malignant adversaries, because they brought iniquity upon him, and did furiously hate him: The <hi>Geneva</hi> note upon the word Iniquity, is this, <hi>They have defamed me, as a wicked person;</hi> namely, by devising false and sinful imputations against me; they took them for true reports, and thereupon, they grew inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and did furiously hate him; and thus <hi>David</hi> bare sin; by bearing patiently their false accusations and imputations of sin.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another Scripture that doth evidently prove that Christ bare our sins, by bearing the false imputations of sin, from the malignant Jews, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.5. <hi>O God thou knowest my foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and my guiltinesses are not hid from thee.</hi> In these words our Saviour doth not complain to his Father of his hard dealing with him, by imputing all our sins to him; but he complains to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the malignant Jews, because they did lay many false and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imputations to his charge; for by foolishnesse, and guiltinesses, in the plural number, is meant sin and wickednesse in abundance: when one accusation could not prevail, they multiplyed their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations one after another.</p>
                  <p>The common doctrine of imputation makes this Query: How did Christ complain to God of his foolishnesse, and guiltinesses; seeing he was in himself free from all sin? They answer it thus, That Christ doth here complain to God, of the heavy load of sin, that he had put upon him, by imputing the sins of all the Elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and thus they make Christ to grudge against his Father, which if it were true, would have spoiled the efficacy of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial obedience: Therefore I reject this interpretation, as not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117340:20"/> consonant to the mind and meaning of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer more directly thus, that Christ doth here complain to his Father against the malignant Jews, because they did most unjustly lay many false and grievous imputations of sin to his charge; yea, through this whole Psalm, our Savior doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to God against the malignant Jews, for imputing so many sinful crimes to his charge; and in the fift verse he doth appeal to God to judge in the case, saying, <hi>O God, thou knowest my foolishnes, and my guiltinesses;</hi> if any such be as my malignant Adversaries do charge me withal: and this appeal is like to that which <hi>David</hi> makes in <hi>Psal</hi> 7.3. <hi>O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be any wickedness in my hands; then &amp;c.</hi> and in this very sense Christ saith, O God, Thou knowest my wickedness, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am a Blasphemer, or an Impostor, or a Traytor against <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> as my malignant Adversaries do charge me.</p>
                  <p>And thus Christ bare our sins, by bearing patiently our false Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of sin; But he doth not complain against God for load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with our sins by his imputation; neither the phrase, nor the coherence will accord to that sense.</p>

                     <q>

                     <hi>King</hi> James <hi>Translation doth render the last clause thus, The Lord hath made the iniquity of us all to meet upon him; namely, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting all our sins to him; and so consequently.

                  <p>I see that the common Doctrine of Imputation is very strongly fastned in your mind, and therefore you do readily take the advantage of every word that hath but any shew of a literal sense that way, though in the true sense of the place it looks a quite contrary way.</p>
                  <p>But for the better understanding of this Text, I will propound two questions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whose sins did the Lord lay upon Christ?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After what manner, and for what end did the Lord lay all our sins and iniquities upon Christ?</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:117340:21"/>
                  <p>To the first question I answer thus. That the Lord laid all the iniquities of all the Elect only upon Christ; They are the lost sheep that are here spoken of: and this exposition the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>The second question is this, after w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at manner and for what end did the Lord lay their iniquities upon Christ?</p>
                  <p>First, I answer Negatively, not by Imputation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer affirmatively, That the true manner how the Lord did lay all our iniquities upon Christ, was in the very same manner as the Lord laid the sins of all Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l upon the Priest and Sacrifice, and no otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">The Lord laid all our sins upon Christ, as upon our Priest and Sacrifice.</note>1. The Lord did lay all our iniquities upon Christ, as upon our Priest; and this was typified in the Law, where the Lord appointed the <hi>High Priest to bear the iniquity of all the holy things of the sons of Israel:</hi> And how must he bear their iniquities? The answer is by his Priestly appearing before Jehovah with his Priestly apparel, and especially with his golden plate upon his forehead, wherein was engraven <hi>Holiness to Jehovah:</hi> Exod. 28.38. and herein the High Priest was a lively Type of the Priestly Nature of Christ, namely of his Divine Nature (which was engraven in his Human Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.) by which he did sanctifie himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.19. when he went into the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly Place of Heaven to appear before God for our Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. as the high Priest did with his golden Plate when he went to make Atonement for all Israel in the holy Place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord laid all our Iniquities upon Christ as upon our Priest; and this was typified by the Lords laying of all the sins of all the Congregation of Israel upon the Priests by their eating of the peoples Sin-offering in the holy Place, for the Lord gave it to them to <hi>Bear the Iniquity of the Congregation, and to make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them before Jehovah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To bear Iniquity and to make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for Iniquity, is all one.</note>
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. Two things are observable in this verse; 1. The manner how the Lord did lay the Iniquity of all the Congregation upon the Priests, and that was by eating the Peoples Sin-offering (as Mediators) in the holy Place. 2. The end why they did eat the Peoples Sin-offering in the holy Place,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117340:21"/> was to make Atonement for them before Jehovah: The former part of the verse saith, That the Peoples Sin-offering was given to the Priests (namely, by the Lords appointment) that <hi>they should Bear the Iniquity of the Congregation:</hi> and the latter pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of the verse sheweth the manner how they did bear the Iniquity of the Congregation; and that was, by making Atonement for them; and their Atonement was made assoon as ever they had eaten the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Sin offering in the holy place. So then, by this Scripture it is evident, That to Bear Iniquity, and to make Atonement for Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, is all one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord laid all our sins upon Christ, as upon our Sacrifice; and this is elegantly expressed by <hi>Isaiah, He poured out his Soul to death, and bare the sin of many, and made Intercession for Transgressors:</hi> Isa. 53.12. All these three terms are <hi>Synonima,</hi> and they are all joyned together in this Text, to declare unto us the true manner how the Lord did lay all our Iniquities upon Christs Sacrifice. 1. He poured out his soul to death, as the bloud of the Sacrifice was poured out upon the Altar in great plenty; and 2. He bare the sin of many, namely, by his Mediatorial Sacrifice; for thereby he procured his Fathers Atonement, and so he bare away their sins from them. And 3. He made intercession for Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors; for he by his own bloud entred into the holy Place, to make intercession for Transgressors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. namely, for all the Elect, who are Transgressors by Nature and Life, and have need of a Mediator to make Atonement for them by his Sacrifice of Atonement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God laid all our sins upon Christ, as upon our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Atonement; and in this sense the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the true nature of the Levitical bearing of sin, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Christ appeared to put away</hi> (or to bear away) <hi>Sin:</hi> This was the end of his coming into the World; and then in <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Christ was once offered</hi> (namely as our Sacrifice of Atonement) <hi>to bear the sins of the many:</hi> This was the means by which he obtained his end: So then, by <hi>Paul</hi>'s exposition of the Levitical bearing, Christ bare our sins (not by his Fathers imputation, but) by procuring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Atonement for us, both as he was our Priest and Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If you will build the common Doctrine of Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon this phrase, <hi>The Lord laid all our Iniquities upon Christ,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:117340:22"/> then by the same phrase you must affirm, That the Father laid all our sins upon himself, by imputing the guilt of all our sins to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for the Father is said to bear our sins as well as Christ; for <hi>David</hi> prayed thus to the Father,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>y Imputation.</note> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.18. <hi>Bear all my sins:</hi> so the Hebrew is. So then, the Father doth bear our sins as well as the Son: The Son bears our sins Mediatorially, by his Sacrifice of Atonement, namely, as it was the meritorious procuring cause of his Fathers Atonement; but the Father doth bear away our sins by his Atonement, Pardon, and Forgiveness, and thereby a sinner is made formally just: and thus <hi>David</hi> meant when he prayed to the Father to bear all his sins, namely, to bear away the guilt of them from him, by his free pardon and merciful forgiveness: and as soon as ever a sinner hath obtained the Fathers bearing of his sins, he is formally just, and so he is in a blessed condition: and so <hi>David</hi> doth explane the matter in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Blessed is the man whose Transgression is born:</hi> (So the Hebrew is) namely, whose Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression is born away by the Fathers Atonement and Forgiveness: and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth so expound the Hebrew Word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Blessed is the man whose Transgression is forgiven:</hi> So then by this comparing of <hi>Davids</hi> Hebrew word with <hi>Pauls</hi> Greek word, it follows, that the Father bears our sins from us by his Atonement, that is to say, his Forgiveness: and this Interpretation is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by other Scriptures; <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>I will confess my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions to the Lord, and thou barest the Iniquity of my sin:</hi> Psal. 32.5. and <hi>Job</hi> doth thus expostulate with the Father, <hi>Why dost thou not bear my Trespass, and pass over mine Iniquity?</hi> So the Hebrew is in <hi>Iob</hi> 7.21. and <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>I beseech thee, O Lord, Bear away the Iniquity of thy servant:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. And the godly Converts in <hi>Hosea</hi> pray thus, <hi>Take away</hi> (lift up, or bear away) <hi>all Iniquity:</hi> Hos. 14.2. that is to say, Pardon or Forgive our Iniquities; not only as a Judge when he forgives or acquits a Malefactor, but as a Father forgives his children, and receives them into favor; and therefore the godly Converts in the next words say thus, <hi>Receive us graciously,</hi> or do us good; and indeed when the Father doth bear away our sins, by his atonement, he doth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully forgive them, and receive them at the same time into favour, as his adopted children: and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> doth describe the nature of Gods pardon and forgivenesse, thus; <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And it is further evident, that the Fathers bearing of Sin, is a term of his merciful and Fatherly Atonement, by <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1. for there <hi>David</hi> doth describe the true nature of the Fathers Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to poor beleeving sinners, by three terms, which are all Synonima.</p>
                  <p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Bessed is the man whose transgression is born.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Blessed is the man whose sin is covered.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>All these thre terms may thus be opened.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Blessed is the man whose sins are born away,</hi> or forgiven; (namely) by Gods merciful Atonement, as the Apostle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Blessed is the man whose sins are covered;</hi> namely, by the Fathers merciful Atonement: for that person that covers sin in this Text, must not be understood of the Mediators covering, but of the Fathers covering, and of the Fathers bearing of sin away: in like sort in other places of Scripture, the Godly do pray to the Father, mercifully to cover their sins, or to free them from their sins; both expressions are joyned together in <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.9. rid us free, and mercifully cover our sins, and our trespasses; thou wilt mercifully cover them, or expiate them, by thy pardoning mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.4. Again, <hi>Thou hast forgiven the iniquitie of thy people; thou hast coved all their sins. Selah. Psal.</hi> 85.2. In this Text the Prophet doth open and expound the Fathers covering to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117340:23"/> else but his mercyful forgivenesse. Again, God being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate, did mercifully cover their iniquity; that is to say, he did mercifully forgive their Iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.38. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the enemies of Gods people grew implacable, in their malicious designes, the Godly did thus imprecate the wrath of God upon them; saying, <hi>Cover not their iniquitie, nor let their sin be blotted out. Neh.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Psal</hi> 69.27. therefore it follows by good consequence from the premises, that whensoever the Father doth cover any mans sins, he doth blot them out of his remembrance, by his merciful Atonement, pardon, and forgivenesse.</p>
                  <p>The Mediator also doth cover sin; namely as a Mediator, by procuring the Fathers pardon and forgivenesse; for by his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Sacrifice of Atonement, he procured his Fathers Atonement; and in that respect he is called the propitiation for our sins, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. and in that respect also, the burnt offerings, Sin offerings, and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe offerings, (being types of Christs sacrifice of Atonement) are said to cover sin; namely, by procuring the Fathers Atonement. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.36. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.6.10.13. And so <hi>Iacob,</hi> by a guift of Atonement, did cover <hi>Esaus</hi> face; that is to say, He did procure <hi>Esaus</hi> Atonement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.20. And the mercy seat that covered the Ark, is called <hi>The covering mercy seat, Exod.</hi> 25.17. but the 70. translate it the propitiatory covering: which term the Apostle doth apply to Christs Sacrifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; saying, <hi>Whom God hath fore-ordained to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. But as I said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re-while, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> speaks not of the Mediators covering, but of the Fathers cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin, by his merciful Atonement, which is the only formal cause of a sinners justice or Iustification, for it is God the Father that doth justifie poor beleeving sinners. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Blessed is the man whose iniquity is not imputed,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Fathers legal justice: A malefactor that is legally acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his sin, by the Judge, (it may be for want of due proof) hath no sin imputed to him legally: but yet the Iudge may still su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him to be a sinner; therefore the Iudges Atonement or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation towards such a sinner, doth much differ from God the Fathers non-Imputation of sin; for whensoever God the Father doth not impute sin to any, he doth fully acquit such sinners, not only as a Iudge, but also as a reconciled Father: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117340:23"/> and therefore they must needs be fully blessed, whose iniquities are not imputed by the Father.</p>
                  <p>All these 3 tearms are <hi>Synonima</hi> and they do all sweetly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound each other, and they do all set out the true manner, how sinners are made just and blessed, namely, when their sins are borne away, Covered and not imputed by the Fathers mercifull Attonement, pardon and forgiveness.</p>
                  <p>But now I will againe returne unto that phraise in <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.6.</p>
                  <p>How the Lord laid all our iniquities upon Christ; namely, not as the common doctrine of imputation teacheth,<note place="margin">The common doctirn of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is built upon such words and phrases as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get many absurd consequences.</note> from the phrase of the Lords laying our iniquities upon Christ, for then this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd consequence will presently follow; that the Father must lay all our sins upon himselfe by imputation, as well as upon Christ by imputation, for the Father doth beare our sins as well as Christ. 2 ly. If God the Father was angry with the mediator because he did beare our sins, then God the Father must be angry with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, because he in like sort doth beare our sins: such absurb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences as these, the common doctrin of imputation doth often fall into. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>I do not take this phrase of the Lords laying our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon Christ, from that kind of bearing sin, which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Priests and Sacrifice, as you do, but from an other Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall practice, namely, from the imposition of hands upon the head of their sacrifices; every owner must impose both his hands upon the head of his sin-offering, and so make confession of his sins, upon the head of his sin-offering: this imposition of hands, did typifie the Lords laying our sins upon Christ, by imputation, and so Godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positers do understand it; see Exod.</hi> 29.10. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4.4.29. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12, 21.</p>

Thirdly, neither can that imposition of hands which was done by the Priest, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.3. nor by the High Priest in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. represent God the Fathers action, for the Priests and High Priests, were types of Christs Priestly nature, and not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore, their imposition could not represent the Fathers action, in his imputing our sins to Christ.</p>

                     <hi>What then I pray you did this imposition of hands, with confession of sin, upon the head of the sin offering signifie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Imposition of hands with confession of sin upon the head of the sin offering, can not be a type of Gods imputing our sins to Christ, but it signifies the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners faith of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</note>It signified the owners faith of dependance, upon his Sacrifice of Atonement, for the procuring of the Fathers Atonement for all those sins that he had confessed and repented of; for no mans sin-offering was accepted of God, except he made confession of his particular sins unto God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.5, 6. which confession of sin was ever joyned with a promise to forsake sin, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.20, 21. and the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Doctors do also say, that Atonement is not made for any man untill they confesse, and turne away from doing the like againe for ever, see <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.5. and in <hi>Num.</hi> 5.7. Atonement is not made for sins past, without particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and without a promise of forsakeing the same sins for time to come; and therefore the practise of the Ceremoniall Law, was to renew their sacrifices of Atonement, as they renewed their sins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No mans sin-offering was accepted upon the Altar, unless he imposed both his hands, and leaned with all his might upon the head of his sin offering: and this imposition, was to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie and to testifie his faith of dependance in resting and leaning upon Christs Sacrifice of Atonement, as the meritorious procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause of the Fathers Atonement: And in this sense the Apostle doth teach us to understand this imposition of hands; <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart to him and with fulness of faith, Heb.</hi> 10.22. that is to say, with the faith of full dependance, leaning upon Christs mediatoriall sacrifice of Atonement, for the procuring of his Fathers Atonement; and the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Doctors do thus expound this imposition of h nds, with confession of sin upon the head of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117340:24"/> the Sacrifice, They say that neither reconciliation doth in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. nor the sin offering nor the trespasse offering, do make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any, but for them that repent and beleeve in their Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: See <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.4. and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4. and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacrifice of Atonement can any man beleeve in and depend upon, but the Sacrifice of Christ, who made his Soule a sacrifice of Atonement for all our sins.</p>
                  <p>And because <hi>Cain</hi> wanted this faith of dependance, therefore his Sacrifice made no Atonement for him; but on the contrarie, it was evill in Gods sight, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.12. and therefore God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. But <hi>Abel</hi> offered a greater sacrifice then <hi>Cain, Heb.</hi> 11.4. because it was offered with faith of dependance upon the mediatoriall sacrifice of Christ, as the procuring cause of his Fathers Atonement; and the true nature of faith is defined by rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or leaning upon, as in <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Esa</hi> 50.10. <hi>as the house doth leane upon the foundation, Esa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Esa.</hi> 10.20.</p>

                     <hi>Your exposition of this Leviticall imposition, is different from the exposition of sundry learned men, who do expound it of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our sins upon Christ by Gods imputation.</hi>

                  <p>If you will make this imposition of hands upon the head of the sin offering to represent Gods laying of all the sins of the Elect upon Christ by imputation, then the same act of imposition upon the head of their Sacrifices of praise,<note place="margin">The common doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is built upon such phrases as doth beget many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd consce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note> must have the same significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for every owner must impose both his hands with all his might upon their Sacrifices of praise (as well as upon the head of their sin offerings) <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.2. but they did not impose hands upon the head of their Sacrifices of praise, with confession of sin, but with the confession of such particular mercies as they had received from God: see <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Levit</hi> 3.2. Therefore that act of imposing hands upon the head of their Sacrifices of praise, cannot signifie Gods laying of our sins upon Christ by imputation; but it must needes signifie the laying of our persons by our faith of dependance upon the Sacrifice of Christ, for the procuring of Gods favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as well when we make confession of particular mercies, as when we make confession of particular sins.</p>
                  <p>And I will now give you some considerable Arguments, why the act of imposing hands upon the head of their Sacrifices, did signifie the owners faith of dependance upon Christ.</p>

Thirdly, They impose hands upon their sacrifices of praise <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.2, 8.13. and then they made confession of such mercies as they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: therefore this act of imposition, must needes represent their faith of dependance in resting and leaning upon the mediatoriall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, as the procuring cause of Gods favourable Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and acceptance, and in this respect the Father doth testifie his acceptation of all the Elect that depend upon the mediator by faith, saying, <hi>Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soule is well pleased: in him shall the Heathen trust:</hi> Mat. 12.18.21. that is to say, in his mediatoriall person and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, shall the Heathen trust, or depend for their acceptance.</p>

                     </gap>n our Saviour ascended into Heaven, he gave his Disciples power to cure diseases, by imposing their hands upon the sick, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. but our Saviour did not meane that they should cure sick persons by the bare act of laying their hands upon the sick, but by their faith especially, which they testified by the act of laying on their hands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came to <hi>Samaria,</hi> they prayed for certain beleevers, that they might receive the Holy Ghost, namely, that they might receive miraculous faith, and other such like gifts of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. and after prayer as soone as they did but lay their hands upon them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghost: and many other signes and wonders were wrought amongst the people by the hands of the Apostles, that is to say, by their miraculous faith, represented by the laying on of their hands; but if any did impose hands upon the sick without miraculous faith, they could not by that action worke miracles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When <hi>Ananias</hi> was commanded to recover <hi>Paules</hi> sight, he laid his hands upon his eyes and said, brother <hi>Saul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy sight, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. and so <hi>Paul</hi> to represent his faith in the power of Christ, did lay his hands upon the father of <hi>Publius,</hi> and so did recover him, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.8.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:117340:25"/>
                  <p>Hence I reason thus, if laying on of hands was used in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Church, as a signe of their miraculous faith, then why may not the same act of laying on of hands upon the head of their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, signifie their faith of dependance upon the Sacrifice of Christ, as the procuring cause of the Fathers A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Fiftly, The action of the hands in holy duties, is often us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to represent the faith of the Godly.</p>
                  <p>As for example, When <hi>Moses</hi> lift up his hands in prayer against the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> it is said that <hi>his hands were faith, Exod.</hi> 17.12. that is to say, were steady, for they were made steady by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> as a signe of his faith which was steady, in the expectation of Gods assistance against the <hi>Amalakites.</hi> Againe, the lifting up of hands in prayer hath been often used as a signe of the faith of expectance: when the soules of Gods people have expected to receive such and such mercies from God, they have lift up their hands to receive what they pray for: <hi>In thy name</hi> saith <hi>David, will I lift up my hands</hi> Psal. 63.5. <hi>and let the lifting up of my hands be acceptable as evening Sacrifice, Psal.</hi> 141.2.</p>
                  <p>And as soone as <hi>Ezra</hi> had ended his prayer, all the people said <hi>amen, amen,</hi> with lifting up their hands by that action, they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their faith of dependance, upon the mediator, for the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they had prayed for, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, when <hi>Moses</hi> deprecated, that God would take away his Plagues from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he spread abroad his hands to signifie his faith in God for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Seventhly, The lifting up of hands was commanded to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Priests, as a priestly action, when they blessed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Temple, immediately after the dayly morning Sacrifice, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.23. and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Aaron lift up his hands toward the people and blessed them:</hi> In like manner after the reading of the Law, in their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> if any Priests were present, they lift up their hands and blesse the people; and this gesture they used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their faith of expectance, that God would certainly blesse

                  <p>From all these considerations laid together, it is evident that the act of laying on of hands with all their might, upon the head of their sacrifices, was to signifie the fulnesse of their faith of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the mediatoriall Sacrifice of Christ, as the procuring cause of his Fathers Atonement, which comprehends under it, his mercifull pardon for our justification, and his favourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our persons, with his adoption.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, If you will make the act of laying on of hands upon the head of the sin offering, to signifie Gods laying our sins upon Christ by imputation. Then the same act of laying on of hands with confession of sin upon the head of the <hi>scape goat,</hi> must also signifie that God did impute our sins to Christ, as well after he was escaped from death by his resurrection and ascension, as when he made his oblation here upon earth; for the High Priest in the name of all <hi>Israel</hi> did impose his hands,<note place="margin">ChrIst doth still beare our sins in Heaven, as much as ever he did here upon earth.</note> and confesse the sins of all the congregation, upon the head of the live <hi>scape goat,</hi> as well as upon the head of the <hi>goat</hi> that was slain for a sin offering: The High Priest cast lots upon these two <hi>goates,</hi> the one was to be kild for a sin offering of the whole Church, and then the High Priest in the name of the whole Church, did impose both his hands upon the head of this sin offering, as it may be certainly proved by <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The High Priest also in the name of the whole Church, did impose both his hands upon the head of the live <hi>scape goat,</hi> and so sent him away alive into the wildernesse, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.7. &amp;c. these two <hi>goats</hi> signified the death and resurrection of Christ: the <hi>goat</hi> that was kild for a sin offering, signified his death, and the live scape <hi>goat</hi> signified the escaping of Christ from death, by his resurrection, and so bearing away the sins of all the Elect from them by his resurrection, ascension and intercession for them in Heaven,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117340:26"/> and it is evident that these two <hi>goats</hi> did typifie the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, for he was put to death concerning the flesh, <hi>but he was quickned by the spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and <hi>Paul</hi> opens it thus, <hi>He powred out his soule to death for our sins, and rose againe for our justification, Rom.</hi> 4.25. so I r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The High Priest did impose both his hands upon the head of the live scape goat, and confessed over him all the iniquities of the Sons of Israel, and all their trespasses, and all their sins, and put them upon the head of the live scape goat, and sent him away by a fit man into the wildernesse,</hi> and so the live <hi>goat</hi> Buck did beare upon him all their iniquities, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.10.21, 22.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev</hi> 16.10.21, 22.</note> and thus by the doctrine of imputation, Christ is gone as a guilty sinner into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But the Hebrew Doctors did not understand this imposition of hands, with confession of sin, of Gods imputation, but they understood it to be as a typicall signe of their faith of dependance upon Christs Sacrifice of Atonement; and so much the prayer of the High Priest doth import, for when he imposed his hands upon the head of the live <hi>scape goat,</hi> he said, <hi>O Lord, make Atonement now for the sins, and for the iniquities, and for the trespasses of thy people</hi> Israel, see Ains. in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.21. <hi>and thus the Lord laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the iniquitie of us all;</hi> or as <hi>King James translation</hi> hath it, <hi>the Lord made the iniquity of us all to meet upon him;</hi> namely the iniquities of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>From this act of laying on of hands upon the head of each of these two <hi>goats;</hi> I reason thus.</p>
                  <p>If the High Priests laying on of hands upon the head of the sin-offering, did represent Gods laying the sins of all the Elect upon Christ by imputation, when he made his soul a Mediatoriall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Atonement for our sins: Then the same action of the High Priest done upon the head of the live scape goat, did also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Lords laying the sins of all the Elect upon Christ by imputation, when hee ascended into heaven to make intercession for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Gods imputing of all the sins of the Elect to Christ, was the cause of Gods extream wrath upon him, when hee made his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117340:27"/> soul a sacrifice for sinne here on earth: then by the same reason Christ doth still bear the wrath of God for our sins in heaven; for Christ doth still bear our sins in heaven, as much as ever he bare them here upon earth. And thus by the common doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (which is built upon this phrase of <hi>Bearing sin</hi>) you cannot avoid the blasphemous consequence.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle never meant that God made him to be sin for us, by a Judiciall imputing of our sins unto him, as Judges doe, when they impute sin and inflict punishment upon malefactors: but the word <hi>made,</hi> and the word <hi>sin</hi> must have another sense.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word <hi>made</hi> is a word of Election and Ordination: God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117340:27"/> made him to be sin, that is say, he ordained him to be our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, namely, as he ordained him to be our Priest and Sacrifice, that so he might make his soul a sin-offering for our atonement.</p>
                  <p>Christ saith thus, <hi>Burnt-offering and Sin thou hast not required, Ps.</hi> 40.6. Christ cals the sin-offering, nothing but sin, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in Greek doth expound it thus <hi>[For sin] Heb.</hi> 10.6. hee joynes the particle <hi>For</hi> to the word <hi>sin,</hi> and thereby he doth teach us, that the sin-offering was not made sin by imposition of hands and by confession of sin upon the head of it: the particle <hi>For</hi> is not sutable to that sense, therefore seeing the Apostle doth explain the word <hi>sin</hi> by the particle <hi>For,</hi> I may well conclude that Christ was not <hi>made sin for us</hi> by Gods imputation, but <hi>he was made sin for us,</hi> that is to say, <hi>A sacrifice for our sins:</hi> and so the Hebrew Text doth sometimes explain it self, by joyning the word <hi>for</hi> to the word <hi>sin,</hi> as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.26. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.15. <hi>The Priest did offer it [For sin.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This phrase <hi>he was made sin for us,</hi> is further opened by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leviticall instance taken from the water of purification, which is called <hi>sin</hi> in Hebrew, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.9. but it was not called sinne in respect of any sinfull quality that was imputed to it, neither was it called sin, because it was imployed to any sinfull use: but it was therefore called <hi>sin-water,</hi> because it was the water of purification from sin, and because it sanctified the unclean, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7. and because it figured the bloud of Christ which purgeth the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117340:28"/>4. If you will stand to the common doctrine of imputation, and still say that God made Christ to be sin for us,<note place="margin">Christ did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all our sins and trespasses to himself as much as ever the Father did.</note> by imputing all our sins to him: then from the same kind of phrase, you must hold that Christ made himselfe a Trespass for us, by imputing all our Trespasses to himself: for <hi>Esay</hi> doth tell us that he made himself A Trespasse, or a guilt for us: so the Hebrew Text speaks in <hi>Es.</hi> 53.10.</p>
                  <p>And if Christ made himself a Trespasse for us, by imputing all our trespasses to himselfe, then he must likewise inflict upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self all the curses of the Law that are due to us for our trespasses: this absurd consequence you cannot avoid by the common doctrine of imputation, because it is raised upon the like phrase of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and thus you make Christ to be his own self accuser and executioner.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, Christ did no otherwise make himself a Trespass or a guilt for us, but as he made himself a Trespass-offering for our sins, he is called a Trespass answerable to the sacrifices of the Law, which are sometimes called A Sin, and sometimes A Trespass: see <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.6. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi> do sweetly agree in their L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will by degrees examine the interpretation of all these Scriptures, <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>That he was grievously troubled,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>That he was sore afraid:</hi> Hence you infer, that Christ could not be thus troubled and thus afraid at a meer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death; Therefore you conclude, that he was thus troubled and afraid at the wrath of God inflicted upon his soul for our sins.</p>
                  <p>This interpretation is taken upon trust from other Expositors: but however, I conceive you will see reason by and by to think that Christ made all this adoe against a meer bodily death only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doe but consider what a horrid thing to true humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the death of the body is, and then consider that Christ had a true Humane Nature like unto all other men, except in the point of sin: and therefore why should not he be troubled with the fear of death, asmuch as his Humane Nature could bear without sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doe but consider that all mankind ought to desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to preserve their naturall lives as much as in them lies in the use of means, in obedience to the sixth Commandment: and therefore seeing Christ as he was true Man could not prevent his death by the use of means, he was bound to be troubled with the fear of death asmuch as any other man.</p>
                  <p>From these two considerations wee may easily collect what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117340:29"/> was the true cause why Christ was so much pained in his minde with the fear of death,<note place="margin">Christ was much pained in his minde with the thought of his death, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of his death came.</note> not only in the night before his death, but at other times also, even long before the time of his death came. <hi>I have a Baptism</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>to be baptised withall, and how I am pained</hi> (or distressed, as a woman in travel) <hi>untill it bee ended,</hi> Luke 12.50.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> in the places cited, speak onely of those sorrows which fell upon him in the night before his death; <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, he began to be grievously troubled, that is to say, he began afresh to be troubled, with the neerer approach of his death then formerly: M. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Harmony upon these words, speaketh to this effect: <hi>We have seen</hi> (saith he) <hi>our Lord wrestling with the feare of death before: but now</hi> (saith he) <hi>hee buckl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th his hands with the temptation: Matthew</hi> cals it the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of sorrow,</hi> because the pains of death were now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: his naturall fear of death lay hid before, but now it doth bewray it self, and the most inward affections of nature lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves open: God had already exercised his Son with some tast of death before, but now hee woundeth deeper by the approach of death, and striketh with an unwonted fear.</p>
                  <p>And in another place M. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith thus: <hi>When Jesus saw</hi> Mary <hi>and the Jews weep for the death of</hi> Lazarus, <hi>he wept also and groaned in spirit, and troubled himself,</hi> Jo. 11.33.35. upon these words M. <hi>Calvin</hi> asketh this question: How doth this groaning and perturbation agree to the Sonne of God? In my judgement (saith hee) it is plain, that when the Son of God did put upon him our flesh, he did also willingly take upon him human affections, that so he might not differ from his brethren in any thing, sin only excepted: and by this means saith he, the glory of Christ is no whit impaired, seeing that his submission was onely voluntary, whereby it came to passe that he was like unto us in the affections of his soul: and by this he proved himself to be our brother, that so we might know that we have such a Mediatour as is touched with our infirmities, and is ready to help us in that which he felt in himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when Jesus groaned again,</hi> v. 38. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, that 'tis no marvell that he groaned again: for the violent tyranny of death (which he was to overcome) was present now before his eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:117340:29"/>
                  <p>By these sentences out of M. <hi>Calvin</hi> wee may see that Christ was deeply touched with the fear of death, for he wept and groaned in spirit, and troubled himself with sorrow for the death of <hi>Lazarus:</hi> I cannot apprehend that he was afraid of the wrath of God for our sins in the night before his death, for then he could not have said as he did: <hi>I have set the Lord alwayes before mine eyes, he is at my right hand therfore I shall not be moved: Ps.</hi> 16.8.

                  <p>But at the first it was otherwise, for when God created <hi>Adam</hi> he gave him affections that were dutifull to reason, and inasmuch as they are now disorderly, it is an accidentall fault: <hi>But the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> (saith he) <hi>that were in Christ were without any disorder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were framed wholly to obey Gods will:</hi> so that if you confer his passions with ours, they will differ no lesse then cleer water from filthy puddle.</p>
                  <p>These sentences of M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> may advise us how we doe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute such a kinde of fear to Christ as might disorder his pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affections, which doubtlesse would have fallen upon him, if he had undergone the pain of losse for our sins, such as the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doe feel in hell, as the common doctrine of imputation doth teach.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:117340:30"/>
                  <p>I apprehend that the quality of our Saviours troubled fear which he suffered the night before his death, did arise onely from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fear of death: and if he had died without any manifest fear of death, it would have occasioned wofull Heresies, yea although Christ was so carefull as he was, to give such evident proof of the truth of his humane nature as he did, yet sundry Heretiques have risen up that have denied the truth of his Humane Nature, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he took no flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but that his body was from heaven of a heavenly nature; it was necessary therefore that he should be stricken with the fear of death as much as his true Humane Nature could bear without sin, as M. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth well observe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the qualitie of his troubled feare of death which he expressed to his Disciples, in the night before his death, had arisen from the sense of his Fathers wrath inflicted upon him for our sins, then you must also say that he suffered his Fathers wrath for our sins, 6. dayes before this, for 6. dayes before this, he said to his Disciples, <hi>I have a baptisme to be baptized withall, and how am I pained, (or distressed in mind as a woman in travell) untill it be ended, Luk.</hi> 12.50. in this speech our Saviour doth express as much distress of mind, as he did in that place of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> which you have cited, and yet I know no Expositer that did ever collect such a tenent from this place of <hi>Luke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Our Saviour doth explaine the qualitie of those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which he suffered at the time of his death, unto the two Sons of <hi>Zebedeus:</hi> He tels them <hi>they must drink of his cup, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with his baptisme, Mark,</hi> 10.39. He tels them that they must be conformable to the qualitie and kind of his sufferings, though perhaps there might be some difference in the degree of their sufferings, and he doth explain the kind of their sufferings, by a two fold expression?</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>He tels them that they must drink of his cup,</hi> that is to say, of the same bitter portion of death, for the term cup is often used for a measure or portion; somtimes it is put for a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or portion of joy and comfort, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.5. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 23, 5. and somtimes it is put for a measure or portion of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or affliction, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.8. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.15.17.28. and this cup is filled somtimes from the Lords hand, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117340:30"/> from mans hand: But in the present case, between Christ and the Sons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> the cup or portion wherein they must parallel each other, is persecutions and death from the hand of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tyrants; yea somtimes the Godly do not only drink a cup, but a full cup of bitter affliction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.10. yea a very great measure, called in <hi>Hebrew, Shalish, of three,</hi> which is a third part of the greatest measure, four times as big as the usuall cup to drink in: see <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He tels them that they must be baptized with his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> that is to say, they must be put to death by the malice of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, as he must be, and this is expressed by the metaphor of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising: for baptising is a diving, or drowning of the whole body under water,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev</hi> 26.10.21, 22,</note> and therfore Christ ordained baptising to be used of his people as a typicall signe of drowning and mortifying the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin in his blood: But baptizing by tyrants, was used to drown mens bodies by death, and therfore Christ saith, <hi>I am entred into the deep waters Ps.</hi> 69.2.15. <hi>Ps.</hi> 88.16. and in this very sence the Apostle saith,; <hi>Else what shall they do that are baptized for dead</hi> (namely, that are baptized with death as Martyrs are) <hi>If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for dead?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. Godly Martyrs would never be baptized with death, if the hope of a better resurrection did not animate their spirits to suffer death for the truths sake, being thereby conformable to the death of Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth intimate in <hi>Phi.</hi> 3.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>By these two expressions, which are <hi>synonima</hi> or <hi>equivalent,</hi> our Savior doth inform the two Sons of <hi>Zebede</hi> what the true nature of his sufferings should be, namely, no other but such only as they should one day suffer from the hands of tyrants: therefore the troubled feare which <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> do ascribe unto Christ a little before his apprehension, must be understood of his naturall feare of death, and not of his Fathers wrath, and so consequently, all the sufferings of Christ were from mans wrath and malice, incited by the Devill (with Gods allowance) but not from Gods wrath: his soule was not touched with any suffering (from Gods wrath at all) except by way of sympathy from his bodily suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings onely.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I conceive you are greatly mistaken to say that Christ did so much trouble himself with the fear of his naturall death
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117340:31"/> onely, seeing</hi> Luke <hi>doth affirm that his troubled feare, caused him to sweat drops of blood, I think no naturall feare of death could have caused such an agony: Therfore doubtless his troubled feare was caused by the feeling of his Fathers wrath, which now had seised upon his soule for our sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Divine,</speaker>
                  <p>If the circumstances of his Agony be well weighed, it will appeare that it did not proceed from his Fathers wrath, but from his naturall fear of death only: The text runs thus: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Agony, his sweat was as it were great drops of blood,</hi> and in another place <hi>Luke</hi> doth tell us, <hi>That the remembrance of his death, did breed a great pain in his minde, long before the time of his death came, even like the pains of a woman in travel;</hi> and such kind of pains in the mind might well be called sweating paines; and as he was true Man he must be touched with the fear of death in a very great measure, as the Prophets did foretell in <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. therefore it was necessary that he should be stricken with the fear of death as much as his true Humane Nature could beare without sin, as I noted ere while from M. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Adde to these pains of his minde, his earnest prayer to be delivered from his naturall fear of death, for he must fully and wholly overcome his naturall fear of death before he could make his oblation; <hi>and therefore he did pray often and earnestly with strong crying and tears to be delivered from the fear of death,</hi> and such prayers may well be called sweating prayers.</p>
                  <p>These two things concurring together in our Saviour, might well cause a violent sweat over all his body▪ with great drops like drops of blood.</p>
                  <p>The feare of death doth often cause men to sweat; and earnest prayer doth often cause men to sweat.</p>
                  <p>Hence I reason thus: If the naturall fear of death, and the striving of the spirit in earnest wrestling prayer, may cause men to sweat, then it might cause our Saviours Humane Nature to sweat much more, 1. because he must be stricken with the fear of death as much as his true Humane Nature could bear without sinne to fulfill the predictions of all the Prophets; and 2. because he could pray above measure, more earnestly then any man, because hee had the spirit of prayer above measure, therefore he might and did so strive in prayer with God for power to overcome his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117340:31"/> fear of death, in which respects it might well cause him to sweat great drops like drops of blood; so then Christ had two things to doe at this time: the one as he was true Man, and the other as he was the Mediatour: 1. as he was true Man, he must be touched with the fear of death as much as his true Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could bear without sin; and secondly, as he was Mediator, he must fully and wholly overcome his naturall feare of death by prayer, before he could make his oblation: for by mutuall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with his Father, his oblation must be an active Mediatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oblation, he must lay downe his own life by his own active will, desire and power, without the least naturall unwillingness to die, <hi>John</hi> 10.17, 18. so that if there had remained in him but the least naturall unwillingnesse to die when he made his obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the efficacy of his oblation had been lost: therefore there was a necessity for him to pray, and to strive in prayer untill hee overcame it, as I shall further explaine the matter by and by in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p>No marvell then, that our Saviour fell into such an Agony in the night before his death, seeing it was not an easie thing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the property of nature from a desire to live, to a desire to die, and that not for his own ends or benefit, but for the sake of the Elect onely; and all this he must perform in exact obedience to his Fathers will; he must observe the due time of every action, the manner, the place, and the persons, and all other circumstances to fulfill every circumstance just as the Prophets had foretold, nothing must fail, if he had but failed in the least circumstance, he had failed in all, and his Humane Nature could not be exact in all these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances without the concurrence of his Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>In all these respects his naturall feare of death could not chuse but be very often in his minde, and as often to put him into pain till he had overcome it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though it be very rare among men to sweat blood, and yet live after it, yet I conceive it is not beyond the power of Humane Nature so to doe: M. <hi>Foxe</hi> in his Booke of Martyrs reporteth from other Histories, that one <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was in such an Agony when he was fighting against the Turks,<note place="margin">See <hi>M. Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Tom. 1. p. 973.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>That the blood hath been seen to burst out of his lips with very eagernesse of spirit onely;</hi> and I have heard also from credible persons, That <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117340:32"/> Great did sweat blood in the couragious defence of himselfe and others in a desperate assault: and it is not unknown unto many that divers years since there was a sweating sicknesse or a violent sweating Feaver, that caused many persons to sweat out of their bodies a bloody humor, and yet many of them did recover and live many years after. But if their sweating blood had been a sign of Gods wrath upon their souls (as you say it was in Christ) then I think they could not have lived any longer by the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doe but consider a little more seriously what a horrid thing to nature the approach of death is: see in how many horrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <hi>David</hi> doth describe it, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.3. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.4, 5. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.4, 5. in this last place <hi>David</hi> saith thus, <hi>My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me, fearfulness and trembling are faln upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me:</hi> he saith, <hi>that his heart was sore pained</hi> (namely, as the pains of a woman in travel) and in <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>horror hath overwhelmed me,</hi> namely, with an amazed quaking, as it often fals out when the human senses are smitten with sudden fear, and so our Saviour was pained in his minde with the thought of his death a long time before the time of his death came: and therefore it must needs affect him the deeper when the time of his death was at hand.</p>
                  <p>Suppose that <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency had grapled with the fear of death, would it not have wrought a strange mutation in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affections? and would it not have wrought a strange paine in his minde? doubtlesse it would, and like enough it would have caused a violent sweat over all his body; no marvell then, if it wrought such a sweating Agony upon our Saviours pure Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is no strange new doctrine to make the naturall feare of death to be the cause of Christs Agony, seeing other learned men doe affirm it: <hi>Christopher Carlile</hi> in his Treatise of Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into hell, <hi>p.</hi> 46. saith thus: <hi>Was not Christ extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, when he for fear of death sweat drops in quantity as thick as drops of blood?</hi> and <hi>Jo: Frith</hi> a godly Martyr saith thus in his Answer to Sir <hi>Tho: Moore B.</hi> 2. <hi>Christ did not onely weep, but he feared so sore, that he sweat drops like drops of blood running down upon the earth,</hi> which was more then to <hi>weep:</hi> now (saith he) if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117340:32"/> I should ask you, why Christ feared and sweat so sore? what would you answer me? was it for fear of the pains of purgatory? hee that shall so answer, is worthy to be laughed to scorn: wherefore then was it? <hi>verily even for feare of death,</hi> as it appeareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his prayer, for he prayed to his Father, saying, <hi>If it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this Cup passe from me:</hi> what Cup was it that Christ would have to passe from him? Surely, it was no other Cup but such as the two sonnes of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> must drink of:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark</hi> 10.38, 39.</note> and what cup must they drinke of, but the bitter Cup of their naturall death; therefore the Cup which Christ drank of, was nothing else but the bitter Cup of death.</p>

                     <hi>I confesse that your interpretation of the cause of Christs Agony, doth make me doubt of my interpretation, and yet I am not satisfied in the point in question, because it is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that Christs Agony was so extream, that his Father was fain to send an Angel to strengthen him, which M.</hi> Calvin <hi>thinks was not sent till after he was in an Agony, and in all likelihood God would not have sent an Angel to support him against the fear of his bodily death, therefore it was to support him under the sense of his Fathers wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Divine.</speaker>
                  <p>It passeth my understanding to finde out how an Angel could support our Saviour under the sense of his Fathers wrath; can Angels appease Gods wrath? or can Angels support a mans soul to bear it? it is absurd to think so: God will not afford the least drop of water to cool any mans tongue that is tormented in the flames of his wrath: therefore that cannot be the reason why God sent an Angel to comfort him.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary it is evident, that God doth often use to comfort his people against the fear of death by the Ministery of Angels: as for example, when <hi>Esau</hi> came to destroy <hi>Jacob,</hi> God sent an Angel to comfort him,<note place="margin">Christ as he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> true Man, so he stood in need of the Ministery of Angels to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him against the fear of death and against other temptations also.</note>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and when <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the Lions den to be devoured, God sent an Angel to comfort him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and he sent his Angel to deliver <hi>Peter</hi> out of prison when his death was determined: why then should not God send an Angel to comfort the Man Christ against the fear of death, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he was true Man, he stood in need of comfort against the fear of death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord had bound himself by promise to support the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117340:33"/> under all his temptations by the Ministery of Angels, as in <hi>Ps.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>Hee shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways; They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</hi> Therefore the Fathers sending of an Angel to comfort his Son in his Agony, was not an evidence that his Father was angry with him for our sins, but it was a sure evidence to him that his Father was highly well pleased with him even in the time of his Agony; and therefore also he sent an Angel to comfort him even in the view or knowledge of his Disciples, that they might take notice of the love of the Father to his Sonne in the time of his Agony, and that they might leave it upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to the Church of God to the worlds end: it is likely that God sent this Angel to assure him that his prayer was heard, and to assure him that his naturall fear of death should be wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him before he made his soul a sacrifice for sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is one chief part of the office of Angels to attend upon the Mediator both at his Birth, Baptisme and Death; God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to attend upon Christ and upon all his members, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of their saddest trials and temptations; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the time of Christs threefold temptation, the Angels came and ministred to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. and this ministery of Angels in the time of his threefold temptation, was a sure argument not of his Fathers wrath, but of his Fathers love, <hi>The Angels of God must ascend and descend upon the Son of Man,</hi> John 1.51.</p>

                  <p>I reverence your Authours, but yet I must tell you that there are other learned and godly Divines, that are contrary to them in the interpretation of this word <hi>Fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> Translators doe read it thus in the margine: <hi>Hee was heard, because of his piety:</hi> and M. <hi>Tyndall,</hi> and M. <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> translate it thus, <hi>He was heard for his Reverence:</hi> and the <hi>Geneva</hi> in other places translate the same Greek word <hi>[godly] fear:</hi> as in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25. <hi>Simeon feared God,</hi> and in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Those that buried Stephen, are called Religious men fearing God,</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. they translate the same Greek word <hi>godly fear, Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with Reverence and Godly Fear:</hi> and in this very sense must the Greek word bee translated in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>He was heard because of his godly Fear, or because of his Reverence, or pious Fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Greek word doth properly signifie such a <hi>Fear</hi> as makes a man exceeding wary and heedfull how he toucheth any thing that may hurt him: it signifies such a wary fear,<note place="margin">True godly fear doth make a soul carefull to doe every duty that may please God, and wary to shun the least sin that may offend God.</note> as men have of the apple of their eye; they are exceeding carefull that not so much as a little mote may hurt it. This kind of wary and tender feare is proper to godlinesse: true godly persons will be very wary, not onely how they may doe every thing that may please God,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117340:34"/> but also how they may avoyd every thing that may offend the tender ey of God, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.1. and such a wary Godly fear was in Christ, (and therefore he is called <hi>the Holy one of God, Ps.</hi> 16.10.) he feared to offend God, lest there should remain in him but the lest naturall unwillingnesse to die, when he came to make his oblation, and therefore he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares, unto him that was able to save him from death: and he was heard because of his godly fear. And by this Greek word, the 70. translate, the Hebrew word <hi>Chasid,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a gracious Saint, or one that is Pious, Merciful, and full of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear and care, <hi>Mi.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.8. and by this Greek word the 70 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Godly fear of the <hi>Rubenites Ios.</hi> 22.24. &amp; in <hi>Le.</hi> 15.31. <hi>Ye shal religiously separate the Sons of Israel,</hi> the 70 say, <hi>ye shall make them wary;</hi> so M. <hi>Ains.</hi> doth render the Greek word from the 70.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I come now to explain the very thing it selfe, from which Christ prayed to be saved, and that was, that he might be delivered from death, and this petition was the Masterpiece of all his prayers.</p>
                  <p>But for the better understanding of the very thing it self, that he did so often and so earnestly pray to be delivered from, wee must consider him with a twofold respect: first as he was true man, and secondly as he was our Mediator. First as he was true man, he prayed to be saved from death conditionally: <hi>If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.</hi> Mat. 26.39.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We must consider him in this Text, as he was our Mediator; and so he prayed to be saved from death absolutely, namely, to be saved from his naturall feare of death, when hee came to make his oblation,<note place="margin">Christ in the dayes of his flesh did often and earnestly pray to his Father to be delivered from his naturall feare of death, when he came to make his obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest it should spoyle the efficacy of his oblation, and he was heard because of his Godly fear.</note> for he knew well enough, that if there had remained in him but the least naturall unwillingness to die, when he came to make his oblation, it would have spoyled the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatoriall efficacie of his oblation, for he had from Eternity Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with his Father, to give his soule (by his own active power) as a Mediatoriall Sacrifice of Atonement for our sins; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.17.18. therefore he must not die a passive death, by the power of man, but he must die as a Mediator, by the actuall and joynt concurrence of both his natures, no man must or could force his soule out of his body, by all the torments they could devise, but he must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate his own soule from his own body, by the joynt concurrence
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117340:34"/> of both his natures; and truely, if there had remained in him but the least naturall unwillingnesse to die, at the time of his oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would have appeared one way or other, for the Lord did try him at his death, with sundry harsh and sharp tryals, for hee gave Satan liberty to instigate the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> against him, and with lyon-like cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hall, and God could not finde any thing against him, because he testified his full acceptance by miracles at his death; and thereupon, the <hi>Centurion said, truely this man was the son of God;</hi> Christ, made his oblation in exact obedience to Gods will, both for matter, manner and time; and therefore as soone as the just appoynted hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (which was foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi>) was come; he did but say, <hi>Father Into thy hands I commend my spirit;</hi> and at that very instant he breathed out his soule, by the power of his God-head, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and this Mediatorial action of his, was the highest degree of obedience, that the Father required, or that the Son could performe for mans Atonement and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; his obedience in his death, was not legall, but Mediatoriall obedience, neither was his death, a bare humane death, but it was a Mediatorial death; it was the death and obedience of God-man: if he had died a passive death, it had been but a humane death, and if he had performed no other obedience but legall obedience, it had been but humane obedience, and then it could not have been meritorious for the procuring of Gods Atonement for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, justification and adoption.</p>
                  <p>But the death of Christ was Mediatorial, and therefore it was very often in his minde, and in his speech long before the time of his death came, as it may appeare by his often telling of it to his Disciples, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.22, 23. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.18, 19.24. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38. see also in <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>Ma.</hi> 9.10.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.22.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.50. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.27. by these Scriptures it is evident,<note place="margin">The Masterpiece of all Christs prayers was to be saved from his naturall feare of death, when he came to make his oblation.</note> that Christ did often speake of his death to his Disciples.: therefore seeing this action of his, was so often in his minde and mouth, he could not chuse but make it the Masterpiece of all his prayers, and doubtless in this respect chiefly, he spent whole nights in prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117340:35"/>
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.37. Yea he spent 40. dayes together in fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; when he did first enter publiquely into his Mediators office, then he prayed for power and strength to do the office of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and therefore it is no question but he did then pray in a speciall manner to be delivered from his naturall unwillingnesse to die, when he came to make his oblation; for if there had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in him but the least naturall unwillingnesse to die at the time of his oblation, it would have spoyled the efficacie of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial oblation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He prayed also to be delivered from the dominion of death, after he had made his oblation, and God heard him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him by his Resurrection on the third day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24.27.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, seeing Christ was so deepely possessed with this Godly feare, lest he should offend God by his naturall unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to die, it must needs banish far from him that horrid feare of Gods wrath which your Authors say this word <hi>feare</hi> doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie: I confess I cannot but wonder that such learned men should expound the word <hi>feare,</hi> in this text, to meane such a dreadfull feare as they must needs feele that lie under the sense of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither doth the word <hi>feare</hi> in this text, signifie such an amazed naturall fear of death, as that other word fear doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.33. which word I have expounded, to signifie our Saviors troubled naturall feare of death, and no more.</p>
                  <p>But I think I have said sufficient already, to prove that this word <hi>fear</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. must be understood of Christs Godly, tender, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie feare, lest he should offend God by his naturall unwillingness to die, when he came to make his oblation; and therefore it caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the dayes of his flesh, to offer up many prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, with strong cryings and teares unto him that was able to save him from death (namely, from his naturall sear of death) and he was heard because of his Godly fear.</p>

                     <hi>Most Interpreters conclude from this Text, that God did suffer his Son in Anger, because he had imputed to him all our sins.</hi>

                  <p>Many Divines I confesse, do make such an Exposition upon the word <hi>forsaken,</hi> in this text, as you do, but yet other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do differ from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Braughton</hi> saith, My God my God,<note place="margin">Christ was not forsaken of God in anger when he suffered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>sheweth that Christ was not forsaken of God, but that God was still his hope.</hi> Secondly, saith he, <hi>The word</hi> sorsaken <hi>is not in the text,</hi> but why dost thou leave me, <hi>but namely, why dost thou leave me to the griefs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the malice of the</hi> Iewes, <hi>as they are expressed in the body of the</hi> Psalme. Thirdly saith he, <hi>None ever expounded one matter, and made his amplification of another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ps</hi> 22. hath amplification of griefes caused by men, and not from Gods anger. Therefore the proposition in Ver. 1. is not a complaint to God, that he sorsooke his soule in anger for our sins.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Robert Wilmot</hi> also in his <hi>Treatise upon the Articles of Christ descent into Hell,</hi> sheweth at large, <hi>that the tearm</hi> forsaken, <hi>is not so proper in this place, as the tearme</hi> leave: and he doth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel it with the word <hi>leave,</hi> in <hi>Ps.</hi> 16.10.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> saith <hi>that this Hebrew word in Ps.</hi> 22.1. which we translate <hi>Forsaken, may be translated, why leavest thou me,</hi> and saith M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> in a Letter to my selfe, <hi>There is no material difference betweene leaving and forsaking, so as the meaning be kept sound, for as God did never forsake his Son,</hi> Ioh. 16, 32. <hi>so God did never leave his Son,</hi> Ioh. 7.29. Ps. 16.8. <hi>But especially, God did not forsake his Son in anger, when he performed the highest act of obedience that ever God required, or that the Son could performe when he made his soule a Mediatoriall Sacrifice of Atonement, yea, Christ himselfe doth testifie that his Father did not forsake him then, but on the contrarie, that he did then stand at his right hand to assist him, that he might not be moved Ps.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Ps.</hi> 109.31. <hi>Ps.</hi> 42.6. <hi>Esa.</hi> 50.7.10. <hi>yea, he doth testifie that he did alshayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in his Fathers love, because he did alwaies keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> Ioh. 15.10.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it followes by good consequence, that Christ doth not complaine in <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. that God had forsaken him in anger for our sins: But our Saviours complaint must run thus, why hast thou left me into the hands of my <hi>Malignant</hi> adversaries, to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117340:36"/> used as a notorious malefactor? It is not so fit a phrase to say, Why hast thou forsaken me into the hands of my malignant adversaries? as to say, Why hast thou left me me into the hands of my malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant adversaries.</p>
                  <p>God forsakes the damned totally and penally, because there is no place of repentance left open to them: but he did not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his Sonne, neither did he forsake his Son by any inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, as hee doth sometimes forsake his own people for the triall of their grace: But he left his Son only outwardly when he left him into the hands of Tyrants to be punished as a malefactor without any due triall of his cause.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the complaint of Christ lies fair and round thus: <hi>Why hast thou left me in my righteous cause unto the will of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant adversaries to be condemned and put to death as a wicked malefactor: formerly they sought daily to take me in the Temple, but they could not apprehend me, because thou didst stand by me in my just cause; But now the howre and power of darknesse is come upon me, because thou hast left me into their hands,</hi> Luke 22.53. <hi>For now thou hast given the Devil leave to enter into</hi> Judas <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me, and into the Scribes and Pharisees to apprehend me, and to accuse me to</hi> Pilate <hi>with sundry grosse and false imputations: Now thou hast left me also into the hands of the</hi> Roman <hi>Deputy to condemne me, and to crucifie me with Lion-like rage, as if I were a grosse Malefactor, without any legall proof of those things which my Malignant adversaries the</hi> Jewes <hi>doe lay unto my charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after this manner that blessed Martyr <hi>John Hus</hi> did expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate his cause with God, for he maintained the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: and yet God left him (as he did <hi>Daniel</hi>) unto the will of his malignant adversaries, namely, unto the will of the Popish Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> so that he could not obtain so much justice at their hands as to have his cause duly tried; they accused him for an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another godly Martyr and Preacher at <hi>Burdeaux: Amond de Laroy</hi> by name, being examined with extream tortures for the truth of the Gospel, fainted away in the time of his torments, but as soon as he came to himself again, he said, <hi>Lord, Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Ex Fox Tom. 2. p. 130.</p>
                  <p>And truly if God had not forsaken <hi>Iohn Huz</hi> in his good cause, his precious faith and constant perseverance, had not been so well known and manifested, for the glory of God, for the witnessing of the truth, and for the good example of others, neither had the tyranny of Antichrist been so much detected, nor so much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as it was by their unjust proceedings against him.</p>
                  <p>And for such like holy ends as these, God forsook <hi>David</hi> in a good cause: see <hi>Ps.</hi> 43.2. <hi>&amp; Ps.</hi> 74.1. <hi>&amp; Ps.</hi> 44.23, 24. <hi>&amp; Ps.</hi> 13.1, 2. and in <hi>Ps.</hi> 42.9. <hi>David</hi> doth there complain to God, saying, <hi>My God, my Rock, why hast thou forgotten me? why goe I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</hi> and just after this sort must the complaint of Christ be understood in <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Why hast thou left me in my righteous cause to be condemned against law and justice, I know no evill in my hands, neither can my malignant adversaries justly and legally prove those sinnes against me which they lay to my charge, and yet they bear others in hand that I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death justly, and therefore in a scoffing manner they say, If thou bee the Sonne of God come down from the Crosse,</hi> Mat. 27.40.42. <hi>he saved others, himselfe hee cannot save, if God will have him, let him delivor him;</hi> and then after all these reproachfull speeches, Christ burst out into this speech, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou left me,</hi> Mat. 27.46.</p>
                  <p>Christ was forsaken in his good cause, not onely by his Father for holy ends, but also by his own dear Disciples; but they did not forsake him in the inward affections of their souls, they forsooke him onely outwardly through humane infirmity for a time; and thus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>V. 15. <hi>Thou hast brought me into the dust of death:</hi> here it may justly be enquired, whether God brought Christ into the dust of Death, after the manner of other malefactors, or how? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that God did not so bring Christ into the dust of death, as he doth other men, namely, not so as death is laid upon man for sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God appointed Christ to die a double kinde of death: namely, as a Malefactor, and as a Mediator at one and the same time.</note>But for the better understanding of the true difference, I will distinguish upon the death of Christ: for God appointed him to die a double kind of death; first, as a Malefactor; and secondly, as a Mediator: and all this at one and the same time.</p>
                  <p>First, he died as a Malefactor by Gods determinate counsel and decree: he gave the devill leave to enter into <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray him, and into the Scribes and Pharisees, and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> to condemn him, and to doe what they could to put him to death, and in that respect God may be truly said to bring him into the dust of death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, notwithstanding all this, Christ died as a Mediator: and therefore his death was not really finished by those torments which he suffered as a Malefactor, for as he was our Mediatour he separated his own soul from his body by the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</p>
                  <p>All the Tyrants in the world, could not separate his soule from his body, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.11.) no not by all the tortures they could devise, till himselfe pleased to actuate his own death, by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both his natures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18.

But the death of Christ, namely, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of his soul from his body was done, not by his torments, but by his own active power, even by the joynt concurrence of both his Natures: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> could not by all his power separate the souls of the three Noble Martyrs from their bodies in the fiery furnace till Christ pleased, for hee was with them in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117340:39"/> midst of the fire to preserve their souls in their bodies, until the time that he had appointed; neither could the hungry Lyons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Daniel</hi>'s body till God pleased; neither could the Divel by all that he could do, separate <hi>Job</hi>'s soul from his body, though he had leave to poison his body with a pestilent inflamation, which broke out into grievous Biles over all his body, from the crown of his head, to the soals of his feet; I say, notwithstanding all this, the Divel could not separate <hi>Iob</hi>'s soul from his body, because God had reserved <hi>Iob</hi>'s life in his own power; <hi>Iob</hi> 2.6. neither could the Sea drown <hi>Ionah,</hi> nor the Whale take away his life, because God had appointed to save his life, as a type of the Burial and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40. The souls of all these persons could not be separate from their bodies by the power of any Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, till Gods appointed time was come, and yet all these were sinners, and therefore they were subject to death, as it was a curse inflicted by God upon man for sin, because he was without sin; and therefore his death must be considered as it was Mediatorial, Active and Voluntary: and yet in some sense he also dyed a passive death, for he suffered the sores of death as the two Malefactors did, and in this last sense it is that Christ saith in this Text, <hi>Thou hast brought me into the dust of death:</hi> Thou didst it, because thou didst give Sathan leave to do it; and Sathan did it, because he did stir up his Instruments to do it; and his Instruments the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees did it, because they did endeavor to do it; for what wicked men endeavor to do, they are often said to do, as is declared at large in the second part: and what God did foretel should be done by Sathan to the seed of the Woman, he may be said to do it; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. see also <hi>Ainsw.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.7. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.22.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, I cannot contradict your Exposition of this Psalm, and yet I am not satisfied in the point in question, and therefore I will propound another Scripture to your consideration, which is much cited by Divines, to prove that Christ bare the Curse of the Law for our Redemption:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <bibl>In <hi>Gal. 3.13.</hi>

                        <p>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us; as it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs upon a Tree.</p>
                     </q>
                     <hi>In these words it seems to me that Christ bare the curse of the Law, even the eternal curse, because he bare our sins by Gods imputation, and the hanging on the Tree was a typical signe of it.</hi>

                  <p>For your better understanding of this Scripture, you must first observe the Apostles drift in this Epistle, which chiefly is to prove, that <hi>we are justified by faith only, without the works of the Law:</hi> which he proves by many Arguments; but in this Text he proves it thus, <hi>By the Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>we are cursed, as it is written in</hi> Deut. 27.26. <hi>Cursed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> and from this curse no corrupt son of <hi>Adam</hi> is able by his own works to free himself.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, I conceive you do not fully express the meaning of that Curse in</hi> Deut. 21.23. <hi>for there it is said, that he that is hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the Curse (not of man, but) of God: And that rare learned Divine</hi> Martin Luther <hi>in</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>saith, That although these two sentences,</hi> He was made a Curse for us, <hi>and</hi> He was made Sin for us, <hi>may well be expounded after this manner,</hi> He was made a Curse, <hi>that is to say,</hi> a Sacrifice for the Curse, and Sin, <hi>that is to say,</hi> a Sacrifice for Sin; <hi>yet in my judgement</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is better to keep the proper signification of the words, because there is greater force and vehemency therein: and in the conclusion he affirmeth, That Christ bare all our sins by imputation, and that he bare the Curse of the Law really for us; and in respect of bearing our sins by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, he saith, that Christ was the greatest sinner in the World, namely, the greatest Thief, Whoremaster, Blasphemer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I confess that Dr <hi>Luther</hi> was a rare Instrument in the Church of God in his days, and he hath expounded the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> better than many others; but yet I believe he is far from the Apostles meaning in this matter; and it seemeth to me that he had some doubt also about his exposition: But he thinketh that the latter curse may well be expounded of his Sacrifice for the curse (and yet that exposition is not right neither) for this latter curse is no other than an outward temporary curse; for the Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.22. runs thus, <hi>If there be in a man a sin worthy of death, and thou hang him upon a Tree,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then he that is hanged is the curse of God:</hi> What curse of God is it that is meant?

                  <p>M. <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. saith, <hi>That the hanging of Christ upon a Tree was not after the manner that is here spoken of, for such as were stoned to death among the Iews, were also hanged up upon a Gibbet after they were dead; and although they were not strangled nor beheaded, but overwhelmed with stones, yet were their bodies taken and hanged up afterwards, that all others might take example at them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in <hi>Moses Rites,</hi> doth from the Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, reckon up the particular sins for which men were first stoned to death, and after hanged, to be eighteen in number.</p>
                  <p>And M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> doth also say, <hi>That the Hebrew Doctors do not understand this hanging, of being put to death by hanging, but of hanging a man up after he was stoned to death; which was done for the greater detestation of such hainous malefactors:</hi> And he reckons up eighteen particular capital offences (from the Hebrew Doctors) that were first punished by stoning to death, and after that by hanging up their dead bodies upon a Tree.</p>
                  <p>And the rebellious son in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.21. is brought as an instance of this double punishment; he was first stoned to death, and then he was hanged up upon a Tree after he was stoned to death: and from this particular instance <hi>Moses</hi> doth infer in <hi>v.</hi> 22. that <hi>if there be in a man</hi> (that is to say, in any other man besides the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Son) <hi>a sin</hi> (that is to say, any other capital sin) <hi>that is worthy of death,</hi> (namely, of this double kind of death) <hi>and Thou</hi> (the high <hi>Sanhedrin) do hang him upon a Tree</hi> (that is to say, after he is first stoned to death) <hi>Thou shalt not let his Carcass remain all night upon the Tree,</hi> (that is to say, not at all in the night) <hi>but thou shalt surely bury him in the same day, at the going down of the Sun;</hi> and the reason is added, <hi>because he is the Curse of God;</hi> namely, because such sinners are more eminently cursed of God than other malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, because they were punished with the heaviest kind of death that the Judges of Israel did use to inflict upon any malefactors.</p>
                  <p>But in some capital cases God dispensed with this Law; as for example, <hi>Rechab</hi> and <hi>Baanah</hi> were by <hi>Davids</hi> commandment first slain, and then their hands and feet (which were the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Treason) were hanged up many days together, for the greater detestation of such like Traytors; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.11, 12. And so were those sons of <hi>Belial</hi> served, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.4. first the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117340:42"/> bodies of the chiefest of them were slain, and then their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were hanged up to appease the Lords wrath: And <hi>Achan</hi> was first stoned to death, and afterwards his dead body was condemned to be burned, and all that he had. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p>Having thus opened the true nature of the Curse in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. let us now examine in what sense the Apostle doth apply it to the death of our Savior; for I confess there is some likeness, and yet I say also, that there is a great deal of difference.</p>
                  <p>First, Every kind of death is the curse of God for sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. But such kind of sinners as are put to death by the Magistrate for capital sins, are more eminently cursed than those that dy by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and therefore, the greater punishment they suffer from the Magistrate, the greater outward curse they suffer.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I grant that the hanging upon a Tree in</hi> Moses, <hi>was but an outward curse, but yet it was a type of that Eternal curse which Christ must suffer when he was hanged upon the Tree for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and so much the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>doth aym at in</hi> Gal. 3.13.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Divine,</speaker>
                  <p>I think I have sufficiently proved that God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the hanging upon a Tree to be a type of the Eternal Curse, for if it had bin appointed by God to be a type of the Eternal Curse, then every one that is now hanged upon a Tree, should be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally cursed, and then divers godly Martyrs that were crucified as Christ was, are eternally cursed, and then the penitent thief was eternally cursed.</p>
                  <p>But if the circumstances of the Text be well marked, they will tell you plainly that this hanging upon a Tree cannot be a Type of the Eternal Curse: For</p>
                  <p>First, This Law of <hi>Moses</hi> must not be understood of puting any man to death by hanging, but of hanging a dead body upon a Tree after it was first put to death by stoning: But Christ was crucified, or hanged upon a Tree not after he was dead, but whiles he was alive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Hanging in <hi>Moses</hi> was done by the Judicial Law, and by the Civil Magistrates, and not by the Ceremonial Law, nor by the Priests.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Hanging in <hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Magistrates of the Jews Common-wealth; But the death which Christ suffered, was a Roman kind of death; for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:117340:42"/> Christ was not condemned to death by the Scribes and Pharises, but by <hi>Pilat</hi> the Roman Deputy. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.31.</p>
                  <p>The Jews had no power in their hands at that time to put any man to death, for if they had had the power of life and death in their own hands at that time, they would first have stoned our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior to death, because they made him guilty of Blasphemy and Witchcraft, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.7. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.33. which sins were punished by stoning to death by <hi>Moses</hi> Law. But the Jews own Writers do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that the Romans had taken away the power of Life and Death from them before this time, namely forty yeers before the Destruction of Jerusalem, which was about two yeers before the death of Christ; <hi>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying what death he should dy;</hi> John 8.32. For Jesus had told his Disciples in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.19. <hi>That the Priests and Scribes should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to scourge, and to crucifie him:</hi> and just so it fell out, for the Scribes and Pharises could not condemn him to death, therefore they delivered him to <hi>Pilat</hi> the Roman Deputy, to be condemned and crucified; and then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers took him, and led him to the Cross; they did mock him, and crown him with thorns, they whipt him with whips, and nayled him to the Cross. This kind of Roman death was used by them for the punishment of notorious malefactors, especially for the punishment of thieves, and fugitive slaves; as M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> noteth in his <hi>Roman Antiq. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>In these particulars you see there was a great difference between the Roman Crucifying, and the Hanging upon a Tree among the Jews.</p>
                  <p>And yet there was some likeness in this kind of death, for both Jews and Romans did hang the basest Malefactors upon a Tree, for a signe of their greater infamy, and so consequently, for a signe of their greater outward curse.</p>
                  <p>Hence I reason thus, when the Romans did put Christ to that kind of death which they used to inflict upon their base fugitive slaves, they made him cursed in his death in the highest degree they could.</p>
                  <p>And yet at that very self same time Christ did redeem us from the Curse of the Law, even from the Eternal Curse,<note place="margin">Christ dyed both as a Malefactor and as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at one and the same time.</note> because Christ dyed not only as a malefactor by the power of the Roman Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117340:43"/> but he dyed also as a Mediator by his own Mediatorial power: In the Jews account he dyed as a malefactor only, but in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he dyed as a Mediator only; In the Jews account he dyed a passive death as a malefactor, by the power of man, but in Gods account he dyed by the active power of his own God-head, even by the joynt concurrence of both his Natures; In the Jews account he dyed a common cursed death, as the other malefactors did that were crucified with him, but in Gods account he dyed a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural death, even by the power of his own God-head; In the Jews account his death was vile and base, but in Gods account it was the highest degree of obedience that the Mediator could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for mans Redemption; and therefore it was accepted of God as a Meditorial Sacrifice of Atonement, and as the meritorious procuring cause of Gods Atonement to all the Elect, for their full Redemption, Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This act of Christ was no corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible thing, but it was an everliving act of Mediatorial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it was no legal obedience, nor was it any humane act of obedience, as all legal obedience must be; but it was a super-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act of obedience, it was no less than a Mediatorial oblation; and therefore it was the meritorious procuring cause of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Curse of the Law, even at that very same time when Christ was made a Curse for us, by Hanging as a Malefactor upon a Tree. The Jews made no other account but that they had put Christ to death (by those Torments which the Roman Souldiers did inflict upon him) as a malefactor; but yet notwithstanding they were greatly deceived, for he shed his own bloud; I mean, he did separate his own soul from his own body by his own active power; and therefore as soon as the just appointed hour was come wherein God had appointed him to make his own oblation, He did but say, <hi>Father, Into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> and at that very instant he yeilded up his soul into the hands of God, as a Mediatorial Sacrifice for our Redemption from the Curse of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Tree on which Christ was crucified as a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, cannot be the Altar; neither were the Roman Souldiers the Priests by whom this Mediatorial Sacrifice was offered up to God; But it was his own God-head that was the Priest, and his own God-head was the Altar by which he offered up his soul to God as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117340:43"/> a mediatorial sacrifice, for the procuring of our Redemption from the curse of the Law.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, I acknowledge that you have given me good satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction touching the curse which Christ suffered in his body upon the Tree, but yet I am not satisfied in the point in question; for good Divines do affirm, that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, not by his bodily, but by his soul sufferings onely, which God inflicted upon his soul when his body was crucified upon the Tree.</hi>

                  <speaker>Divine.</speaker>
                  <p>This kind of reasoning is very absurd, for as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> well observeth, <hi>if Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul, only to redeem our souls, and not in his body, to redeem our bodys, then our bodies are not yet redeemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you will make Christ to be a perfect Redeemer, then you must make him to redeem our bodies as wel as our souls: therefore if Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul, to redeem our souls from the eternal curse, he must also suffer the wrath of God in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to redeem our bodys from the eternal curse, or else our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must still continue under the eternal curse, though our souls be redeemed by his soul sufferings: Is not this to make Christ an imperfect Redeemer: and to leave a doubting conscience in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of doubts and Queries?</p>
                  <p>The truth is, I find much uncertainty among Divines what to affirm in this point: for first,<note place="margin">There is much uncertainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Divines what to affirm, whether Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul only, or in his body also for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> some do affirm that Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul only. Secondly, others affirm that he suffered the wrath of God in his body as well as in his soul, to redeem our bodies from Gods wrath as well as our souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋrsinus▪</hi> doth plainly deny that Christ suffered the paines of the damned in his body: <hi>in Catech. p.</hi> 513. <hi>printed</hi> 1611. <hi>these paines</hi> (saith he) <hi>he suffered not in his body; for the sufferings of his body were only external: therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>he suffered these paines in his soul:</hi> and yet in the same <hi>Catech.</hi> p. 487. he affirms <hi>that Christ suffered the wrath of God both in his body and in his soul, to deliver our souls and bodies from eternal damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like contradiction may be shewed in sundry other Authors, <hi>Polanus</hi> divides the sufferings of Christ into outward and inward, and he applies his suffering of Hell torments to his inward soul suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings only: see <hi>his substance of Religion, p.</hi> 141. 144. <hi>and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingius</hi>

                  <p>We see but in part, and know but in part; God hath some truth to bring to light in every age: the common doctrine of imputation hath much obscur'd the meritorious price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Justification; so that some Scholars do alledge some Scriptures to prove that Christ suffered the wrath of God, and yet they speak nothing at all of any part of his suffering, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 63.3. <hi>I have troden the wine-press of Gods wrath alone;</hi> but they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistake the meaning of this text, for this text speaketh nothing at all of any part of Christs sufferings, neither from Gods wrath, nor from mans wrath: it speaks only of the tryumphant victories of Christ over his and his Churches enemies: others alledge, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. which hath no more affinity with Christs suffering then the former.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The pain of loss,</hi> is the privation of Gods favour by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting seperation: This is the first part of the Torments of hell <hi>which is death Eternal;</hi> for as the favour of God through Christ is the fountain of life, because it is the beginning of life eternal: <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.5. so on the contrary, to be totally seperated from Gods favour by an eternal seperation, must needs be the beginning of hell Torments or of death eternal; for he that is once seperated totally from the favour of God, is at the same time seperated from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforts, he is seperated from the company of millions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and from the general assembly of the first born that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven and from the spirits of just men made perfect, and from Jesus Christ the mediator of the New Testament, whose blood speaks mightier things than the blood of <hi>Abel, Hebr.</hi> 12.22, 23. and this pain of loss is accounted the heaviest part of the Torments of hell, by all divines</p>
                  <p>But yet I think it needful to give you a word of caution, that you do not mistake my meaning in this description of the first part of the Torments of hell; for I do not mean that every loss of Gods favour is to be accounted as a part of the Torments of hell for then many of Gods deer children should often suffer the Torments of Hell in this life; neither do I mean that Reprobates (though they be totally and for ever seperated from the favour of God in Christ) do suffer this part of the Torments of hell in this life; for as long as they live in this life, they do participate of many common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from God; therefore as long as they live in this life, God doth not forsake them with such a total forsaking as he doth after
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117340:45"/> this life: God forsakes wicked men in this life but in part only, he doth not leave wicked men in this life to be as wicked as they would be; but as long as they live in this life, he doth put a bridle upon their corruptions, and by his restraining grace doth keep them in, so that they cannot be as wicked as else they would be; and this is no smal favor of God which he doth vouchsafe to reprobates as long as they live in this world: yea the very devils themselves as long as they live in this world (being Spirits) in the aire, are not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God as they shal be at the day of judgement; for as yet they are not in hell, but in this aire, and therefore they have not their full torments as yet; and so much the very devils themselves did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to Christ,<note place="margin">The devils are not in hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as yet.</note> saying, <hi>art thou come to torment us before the time? Mat.</hi> 8.29.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29.</note> this speech implies a prayer: I pray thee torment us not to the full, for the time of our full torment is not yet till the day of judgement be come.</p>
                  <p>Hence I may well conclude; that the pain of loss which the damned do suffer in hell, is of a far more terrible nature then any wicked man can feel or apprehend in this life: but how terrible it is, I am not able fully to describe; but in general I may well call it a total seperation from Gods favour without any limitation of time: and it is cal'd <hi>an Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p>And yet this pain of loss may be a little further explained, by opening the tearm <hi>second death,</hi> which may be in part described by comparing it to the <hi>first death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A description of the tearme se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</note> which I have at large described to be our spiritual death, or a loss of the life of our first pure nature; or, I may call it a death in corrupt and sinful qualities, as I have opened <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. yea all other miseries which fall upon us in this life, even till our bodies be rotten in the grave, I call them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the <hi>first death,</hi> because they do all befal us in this world: therefore on the contrary the <hi>second death</hi> must needs imply a deeper degree of corrupt and sinful qualities then did befal us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>first death;</hi> for though <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity became dead in corrupt and sinful qualities assoon as ever he had but eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of the forbiden fruit, yet the Lord in mercy did mingle some restraining grace with those corrupt and sinful qualities, so that the very reprobates cannot be so bad as they would as long as they live in this life: but assoon as they do but once come into the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117340:45"/> very place of hell it self, they shall have their full torment of the <hi>Second death,</hi> and then doubtless God will utterly take from them all restraining grace, so that they shall have full liberty to exercise their corrupt and sinful qualities, they may sin as much as they will, without any mixture of restraining grace, and then their liberty of sining shall fill up the measure of their torments to the full; then they shall hate God with a total and an endless hatred, and God will hate them with a total and an endless seperation from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> speaking of the torments of the damned saith, <hi>that their hatred against God is the greatest part of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;</hi> neither can they moderate their hatred against God and his Will (as the reprobates do in this life) because God denies them the help of his restraining grace, they hate God because of his justice and holiness, therefore they shall be tormented with the gnawing worm of an accusing conscience, which shall never dy; <hi>Esay</hi> 66.24. and thus the very tearm second death doth plainly tell us, that it is such a degree of death as surpasseth all the deaths of this life, and that the full measure of it cannot be inflicted upon any man till this life is ended, and then their end shall be without mercy. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>The Second part of the torments of hell: is <hi>the pain of sense, or the sense of all torturing torments;</hi>

                  <p>Now come we to examine the particulars, and whether Christ did suffer these Torments of Hell for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did Christ suffer the <hi>Second death?</hi> was he spiritually dead in corrupt and sinful qualities, without any restraining grace? and did God leave him to the liberty of those corrupt and sinful quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to hate and blaspheme God for his justice and holiness,<note place="margin">An Examination of Christ's suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with the Torments of hell.</note> as the inseperable companions of Gods total seperation? for these sinful qualities are inseperably joyned to them that suffer Hell torments, as the effect is to the cause; did Christ suffer this pain of loss, when he said <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. Did Christ suffer the torments of hell in the proper place of hell? seeing none can suffer the torments of hell as long as they

                  <p n="4">4. Did Christ suffer the torments of hell in his body as well as in his soul, to redeem our bodies as well as our souls from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again the same Author affirmeth in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. that <hi>Hell place, and hell torments are not in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truely it seems to me that the holy Scriptures do confine hell torments to the proper place of hell it self,<note place="margin">Hell place is on high before the Throne of the Lamb, therefore it cannot be in the midst or Center of the Earth, as some affirm.</note> which is <hi>seated on high before the throne of the Lamb; Rev.</hi> 14.10. and <hi>Solomon</hi> doth tell us, <hi>that all mens souls (both good and bad) do ascend, Eccl.</hi> 3.21. and the Hebrew Doctors do hold generally, <hi>that hell is above as well as heaven,</hi> and learned Mr. <hi>Richardson</hi> doth probably conjecture in his <hi>Philosophical Annotations</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. that <hi>Hell place is seated within the Element of fire:</hi> and why may it not be so, seeing that place is next before the Throne of the Lamb, where <hi>Iohn</hi> doth place it? <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. and it is certaine by <hi>Luke's</hi> parable, that hell is seated neer unto heaven, or else the comparisons that <hi>Luke</hi> useth to describe their neerness were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. 1. He describes their neerness by two persons talking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one in Heaven place, and the other in hell place. 2. He describes their neerness by seeing each others case, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and so doth <hi>Esay</hi> in <hi>ch.</hi> 66.24.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:117340:47"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence we may see the reason why <hi>Haides</hi> is put as a common name to both places: both places are usually cal'd <hi>Haides</hi> in sundry greek writers, as if they were but two regions in the same world of souls, one region for the godly, and the other for the wicked, where the godly and wicked may see each others condition, and talk together in their next adjacent parts, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. Therefore hell place is not in the midst of the earth amongst the moles and wormes, as some blind Papists do affirm, but 'tis on high, before the throne of the Lamb, and within the view of the glorified Saints.</p>
                  <p>But whether the Element of fire be the proper place of hell or no, I need not dispute that point, yet this conclusion doth arise from the premises that no man can suffer the torments of hell as long as they live in this world, therefore our Savior could not suffer the torments of hell in this world, as the common doctrine of imputation doth teach, neither did his soul go into the proper place of hell after death, to suffer the torments of hell for our redemption, for he told them there that he went <hi>that day to para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:</hi> neither can any soul that goes to hell ever return any more into this world; except at the day of judgement, and then every soul must come to be reckoned to its own body, that so both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may <hi>be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death. Rev.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is evident that Christ did not suffer the torments of hell in this world,<note place="margin">Christ did not suffer the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell for our sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rule of Gods Iustice to punish an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocent with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, for the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</note> because there was no necessary use or end of such sufferings, for such sufferings are no way satisfactory to the justice of God for our sins; for the rule of Gods justice doth require <hi>that soule only to dy which sins: the soule that sins shall dy: one man shall not dy for another mans sin, Ezek.</hi> 18. By this rule of justice God cannot inflict the torments of hell upon an innocent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a guilty person; and as God doth ty himself to this rule of justice touching the everlasting state of mens souls; so he doth appoint civil magistrates to observe this rule of justice touching the bodies of sinful malefactors, they may not punish an inocent for a guilty person, but <hi>that man only that sins must dy,</hi> as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. doth expound the meaning of the Judicial law in <hi>Deu.</hi> 24.26.

                     <hi>You say that God cannot by the rule of his own justice punish an inocent for a guilty person: and yet God did punish many thousands of</hi> Davids <hi>inocent subjects for</hi> Davids <hi>sin in numbring the people.</hi>

                  <p>This case is different from the former, for the former case was propounded touching the eternal estate of mens souls: and in that case I said that God cannot in justice punish an inocent soul eternally for the sins of another man: But that instance is touching Gods dealing with mens bodies, In this case I grant that God may by the rule of his own justice punish the bodies of many inocent for another mans sin, and the reason is plain, because men in the world, both elect and reprobates are liable to Gods justice for their bodily death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. And therefore God may call them to dy whensoever he pleaseth: thereupon sometimes it is his good will and pleasure to let men live long, and sometimes it is his good will and pleasure to call for their lives upon occasion of some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking sin or other in some other man, and then it is his good will and pleasure to punish that provoking sin by the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands that had no hand in that sin: and in this sense God doth often punish the sin of the Father upon the children, and the sin of the Children upon the father, and the sin of the King upon his subjects: as in the case of <hi>David: he alone sinned in numbring the people:</hi> and thereupon, <hi>God was pleased to punish his sin with the death of many thousands of his good subjects,</hi> and yet God did no injustice to any man in so doing, because they were all indebted to his justice for their bodily death whensoever it pleased him to call for it.</p>

                  <p>I grant that the ways of redemption are rank'd into three sorts. 1. By exchange of one captive for another; but we are not thus redeemed, for God did not give his Son into the hands of Sathan to redeem us from under the power of Sathan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a redemption by force and strength: but this may be called a deliverance rather then a redemption; but however, Christ did not thus redeem us from Gods wrath, for then Christ must be stronger then his Father; but himself doth testifie, that his <hi>Father is greater or stronger then he, Iohn</hi> 14.28. Therefore Christ did not redeem us from his Fathers wrath by force and strength: but yet after this sort he doth deliver us dayly from the power of Sathan, for <hi>he is stronger then that strong man Luke</hi> 11.22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, and so consequently from his Fathers wrath, by no other way or means but by that rich and unvaluable price or merit of his Mediatorial Obedience; and this way of redemption is often taught and confirmed by the Holy Scriptures: as in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a price:</hi> Namely <hi>with the precious blood of Christ as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. it is called precious, because it was the blood of that person that was God as well as man; and 2. it is called precious by the figure <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynomia,</hi> because it is put for all his Mediatorial Obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Mediatorial Sacrifice was the Master Piece; for that act of his was the highest act of obediemce that ever God required, or that the Mediator could perform for our Atonement and redemption: and in this sense only <hi>we have Atonement, Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through his blood Eph.</hi> 1.7. and in this sense <hi>he gave his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for the many; Mat.</hi> 20.28. and in this sense <hi>he gave himself to redeem us from all iniquity, and to clense us to himself: Titus</hi> 2.14. the gross substance of that blood that was shed by the <hi>Romans</hi> in a passive manner, is not to be taken by it self, alone considered, for that precious price; neither doth the gross substance of blood clense any, but defiles; therefore we must take the blood of Christ by the figure <hi>Metynomia,</hi> for his Mediatorial Obedience whereof his Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement was the Master piece: and in that sense it procures the Fathers Atonement, and in that sense it doth clense the soul fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117340:50"/> freed from the guilt of all sin: and in this sense <hi>the blood of Iesus Christ</hi> his Son, <hi>doth clense us from all sin</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. his sacrifice did procure his Fathers Atonement, because it was a Mediatorial Sacrifice, for <hi>he offered himself by his eternal spirit. Heb.</hi> 9.14. In the Iews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Christ died only a passive death, but in Gods account he died a mediatorial active death; and therefore it was accepted of God as a pleasing sacrifice, for the procuring of our Atonement and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: neither silver nor gold, or any other corruptible thing could procure our Atonement and redemption; no other thing could procure it but the highest degree of obedience which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator could perform, which was his mediatorial sacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement: it was no legal obedience, nor any other human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was a sufficient price for our redemption, but it was that precious thing or act of his Mediatorial Obedience in his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was a super-natural obedience; and therefore it was accepted of God the father as the meritorious procuring cause of our Atonement and red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mption: and so consequently it was that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing of price by which Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, and from his Fathers wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This way of our redemption was taught and typified by that price that all Israel gave for the redemption of their lives ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after their coming out of Egypt: the rich might not pass, nor the poor might not diminish from half a shekel: both must give a like price for their redemption: (and these half shekels were after used to buy the dayly morning and evening sacrifices, which were publick sacrifice for the whole Church of Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l) and this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption money was given yeer by yeer, because the law made nothing perfect at once: <hi>see Ains. on Exo.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.32, 33.</p>
                  <p>And this redemption money (or part of it at least) was called <hi>sin money,</hi> and <hi>Trespass money,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.16. because it was employed to buy the publick <hi>sin offerings,</hi> and <hi>trespass offerings</hi> as well as the <hi>dayly Burnt Offerings;</hi> and it was imployed also to build the Sanctuary, or to repair the Temple, as I have formerly noted on <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
                  <p>And this ceremony might teach them and us, that Christ should redeem us by making his soul <hi>a sin offering,</hi> and <hi>a trespass offering</hi> for the procuring of his Fathers atonement for our ful redemption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is evident by another Typical ceremony of redemption
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117340:50"/> that Christ hath redeemed us by a price only (and not by bearing the curse of the law for us) for in <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.25.39.47. it is said <hi>if any man through poverty be not able to redeem himself or his land from bondage, then his brother or his next kinsman must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them by a price of money or money-worth; and not by going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his brothers poverty to suffer his misery in his stead:</hi> and in this sense Christ the antitype became man, that he might become our brother and neer kinsman in the flesh, that so by the right of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood he might have a direct enterance to do the office of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for us by the rich and weighty price and merit of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial Obedience, whereof his Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the Master Piece, for that was the most precious thing that either God the Father could require, or that the mediator could perform for our Atonement and Redemption.</p>

                     <hi>You make the mediatorial sacrifice of Christ to be the only satisfactory price to Gods justice for our redemption: and in effect the</hi> Lutherans <hi>say as much, they set as high a price upon the blood of Christ as you do, for they commonly say that one drop of the blood of Christ is sufficient to redeem the whole world, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they do also say and affirm that Christ suffered the wrath of God according to the curse of the Law, for our redemption: and this suffering of Gods wrath they make to be as necessary for our redemption as his Mediatorial Sacrifice, therefore in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in the judgement of divers other</hi> Protestant <hi>writers, Christ hath redeemed us both these ways:</hi> Namely <hi>by paying unto God the price of his precious blood, and by bearing his Fathers wrath also in the same proportion as it is due to us from the Curse of the Law.</hi>

                  <p>There are two dangerous errors in this tenent of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> 1. it is a most dangerous error to affirm that Christ hath redeemed the whole world.

                  <p n="1">1. It is a dangerous error to affirm that Christ hath redeemed the whole world, he never intended to redeem all Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he never intended to redeem any but the <hi>Many:</hi>

                  <p>I grant that the term <hi>Many</hi> in some places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be understood of mankind in general; but yet not in the place that you have cited: I grant that all mankind in general are become sinners through <hi>Adam</hi> fall, but yet that text which you have cited aims only to prove, that the Elect number are made sinners through <hi>Adams</hi> fall, because the Apostle doth by and by after counterpoise <hi>many</hi> to <hi>many,</hi> saying, <hi>As by one mans disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> many <hi>were made sinners, So by the Obedience of One, shall</hi> many <hi>be made righteous: Rom.</hi> 5.19. Here the last term <hi>many</hi> must parallel the first term <hi>many:</hi> and this last term <hi>many</hi> cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of any others but of that <hi>many</hi> only that have the benefit of Christs Mediatorial obedience to cure their sinful condition that came by <hi>Adams</hi> dis-obedience.</p>
                  <p>In briefe therefore, the sense of the Apostle must ly thus: <hi>as by one mans disobedience the</hi> many (<hi>that is to say the elect number were made sinners</hi> as well as the reprobates, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>So by the Obedience of</hi> ONE <hi>the</hi> many <hi>are made righteous:</hi> no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates can be included in this <hi>many,</hi> because they are not made righteous by the Mediatorial Obedience of Jesus Christ: but the <hi>many</hi> elected ones only: for by the Mediatorial Obedience of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, whereof his sacrifice of Atonement was the Master piece, he procured his Fathers Atonement to all the elect for their full righteousness, redemption, or freedome from the guilt of sin, and so consequently from the curse of the law, and from his Fathers wrath: and for these <hi>many</hi> onely and not for the rest of the world doth Christ make intercession to his Father; <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19. <hi>Psa.</hi> 16 4. And for these only he did sanctifie himself <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this speech of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> whereby they labor to promote the doctrine of a general redemption, doth argue their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117340:51"/> great ignorance in the Articles of the Eternal Covenant which was made between the Father and the Son for mans Redemption.</p>
                  <p>But they labor to prove their tenent by several Scriptures, as by <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.19. where Christ is said <hi>to be the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World;</hi> also they alledge, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. where Christ is said to <hi>be the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole World:</hi> To these Scriptures I answer, that the word <hi>World</hi> must not be taken for the universal number of all mankind, but it must be taken for the World of Believers only, as the matter is explained by <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the</hi> VVorld, <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life:</hi> In this Text the word <hi>World</hi> is explained, to mean such only as believe in Christ; and in <hi>verse</hi> 18. <hi>They that believe not in the only Son of God, are exempted from Righteousness and Redemption by Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, they alledge that <hi>Christ dyed for all men in general,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>That Christ died for All:</hi> To this I Answer, that the word <hi>All</hi> in this Text, must be taken for all the Elect only, and no more; it must be limitted to all of that sort of persons of which he speaks; namely, to <hi>that</hi> All <hi>which live not to themselves, but unto him that dyed for them;</hi> he never shed his bloud for such as live to themselves, but for such as live unto him that died for them: and this Interpretation is further cleered by another Scripture, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. <hi>of his fulness we all receive;</hi> that is to say, all we which do believe: So <hi>Christ healed all that were sick, Mat.</hi> 8.16. that is to say, all the sick persons that were brought unto him: and therefore another Evangelist doth explain it thus, <hi>He healed many, Mar.</hi> 1.34. and the word <hi>All</hi> is often put for <hi>many,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.57.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I may well conclude, that this Assertion of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> is a dangerous Error, for by it they make every profane person believe, that they have as good a share in the bloud of Christ, as any of Gods people have, if they can but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, intimating thereby that they may repent when they will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is another most dangerous Error of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to ascribe the price of our Redemption to one drop of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real bloud of Christ; for it is a common saying among them, that one drop of the bloud of Christ is sufficient to redeem the whole world.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:117340:52"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">One drop of the Bloud of Christ is not sufficient to redeem the whole world.</note>But if this speech of theirs be well examined, it will appear that one drop of the bloud of Christ was not sufficient to redeem the Elect; much less was it sufficient to redeem the whole world in general: for Christ must by Gods appointment shed as much bloud as was sufficient to make his oblation withal: But one drop was not sufficient to make his Oblation; Therefore one drop was not sufficient to redeem the Elect, much less was it sufficient to redeem the whole world: Christ knew well enough that the bloud of the burnt offering, and the bloud of the trespass offering, (which was a type of his own bloud) must be shed in such a large quantity, that the Altar must be filled with it round about, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.5.

The Original word doth signifie <hi>A pouring out with sprinkling:</hi> And the Hebrew Cannons tell us, that the Priests must endeavor to receive all the bloud in bowls, that there might be sufficient at twice sprinkling to ly thick upon all the four sides of the Altar; as it is written in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Round about the Altar:</hi> and the rest of the bloud that was left, the Sacrificers poured out at <hi>the bottom of the Altar; Exod.</hi> 29.12. and thence it was conveyed by spouts into the Brook <hi>Kidron:</hi> See <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.7. yea it was the Lords express commandment concerning all Sacrifices in general, <hi>to pour out the bloud</hi> (namely by a large and liberal sprinkling) <hi>upon the Altar of Jehovah, Deut.</hi> 12.17. and Christ did fulfil this type when <hi>he poured out his soul to death, Isa.</hi> 53.12. so the Hebrew is; but <hi>Paul</hi>'s Greek in <hi>Rom</hi> 4.25. is taken from the seventy on this place,<note place="margin">The holy Ghost in Hebrew and Greek doth make the death of Christ to be both active and passive wherein a great mystery is couched.</note> which is passive; <hi>He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to death for our sins:</hi> and thus the holy Ghost in Hebrew and Greek doth make the death of Christ to be both Active and Passive, because in his death he died both actively and passively: for he suffered passively from man as a Malefactor, and yet he did actuate his own death, by seperating his soul from his body by his own active power, or by the joynt concurrence of both his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and because he did freely pour out his soul to death, therefore his death was typified by a large quantity of bloud, which was sprinkled by the Priest upon the Altar. It was the practise of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters also, to pour out the bloud of their Sacrifices; but of such the Mediator saith, <hi>I will not pour out their poured out Oblations of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117340:52"/> bloud:</hi> that is to say, I will not make Atonement for them, by pouring out my bloud for them; <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.4, I am loth (saith D. <hi>Hampton</hi>) to believe that either the Father was so prodigal of his Sons life, or that the Son was so careless of his own bloud,<note place="margin">see D. Hampton in his sermon on Rom. 10.4. printed <hi>1609.</hi>
                     </note> that he would have poured out all, if one drop would have served the turn.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the quantity of his bloud must answer the type of pouring out, so the quality and manner of shedding it, must answer to the Typical Sacrifice: First, no bloud was acceptable in sacrifice, but that which was of a clean beast: and secondly, No bloud was acceptable but that which was sprinkled by the Priest: It was not the bloud of Christ which was shed as a Malefactor, neither was it the bloud of Christ as it was shed by the Roman Souldiers, that was sufficient for our Redemption; but it was the bloud of Christ who was the <hi>Lamb of God without spot:</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it was the bloud of Christ that was <hi>poured or sprinkled by his Priestly Nature,</hi> namely, by his God-head, that God accepted as the meritorious procuring cause of his Atonement for our full Redemption: It was not the gross substance of his bloud that God the Father regarded, no otherwise but as it was a <hi>Metynomia</hi> of his Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement; for his material or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal bloud was spilt upon the ground, and it was soon dryed up, and God knows what is become of it now, but it was the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious efficacy of his bloud that he regarded, which I call his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial Sacrifice of Atonement; that bloud is never dried up, but it doth ever live to procure Gods Atonement for the full Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of all the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it must needs be a dangerous and a superstitious error of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to ascribe so much to one drop of the material bloud of Christ.</p>

                  <speaker>Divine,</speaker>
                  <p>The true meritorious efficacy of the bloud of Christ,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117340:53"/> lies not in this, that it was a part of the corporeal substance of the Lamb of God without spot; nor in this, that he suffered his bloud to be shed by the Roman Souldiers in a passive manner of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but it lies in this, that it was shed by his own active Priestly power, by which means only it became a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement:<note place="margin">The true force and efficacy of the blood of Christ lies in this, that he did actually pou e out hs own soul to death by his own preistly power: by which meanes only it became a mediatorial sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement.</note> and yet notwithstanding, though I do not place the efficacy of his bloud neither in the material substance of his bloud, nor in the passive shedding of it; yet I do freely grant that both his material bloud, and the passive shedding of it, are often put by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and by the figure <hi>Metynomia,</hi> for his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Sacrifice of Atonement: as for example, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>we have Redemption through his bloud;</hi> This term <hi>bloud,</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood with a grain of Salt, for the term <hi>bloud</hi> here, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the figure <hi>Metynomia,</hi> for the signe and token of his death; and secondly, the term bloud and death in the passive acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is often put by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> for his active Mediatorial death; because at one and the same time Christ died both as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator actively, and as a malefactor passively; as I have explained the matter in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and in other places also; therefore seing there is such a concatination of his active Mediatorial death with his passive death, they may well be put the one for the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably, because they were so interwoven together at the same time; and in this respect the holy Scriptures do indifferently put the one for the other: this distinction I hope the wise will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily understand.</p>
                  <p>But for your better understanding of the meritorious efficacy of the bloud of Christ, consider two things, First, Consider what was the Priestly Nature of Christ; and Secondly, Consider what was his Priestly Action.</p>
                  <p>First, His Priestly Nature was his Divine Nature; for he is said to be <hi>a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck,</hi> of whom it is witnessed, <hi>that HE liveth,</hi> or <hi>that HE ever liveth: Heb.</hi> 7.8. This term HE,<note place="margin">Christ is a preist for ever by his Divine nature see Heb. in melch. p. 34. &amp; in Rev. 107.</note> importeth the nature Ever-living; and then it must needs mean his Divine Nature, for his Human Nature was dissolved by death: The like Emphasis is in the word HE, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.27. <hi>Thou art HE, and thy yeers fail not;</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this HE of the God-head of Christ, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10.12. In like sort the term HE runs in this sense, in the first promise made to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117340:53"/>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, HE shall break thy head, Gen.</hi> 3.15. who else can HE be that shall break the Divels head plot, but that HE that is the Son of God? And thus the Apostle <hi>John</hi> doth expound that HE, saying, <hi>For this cause [HE] the Son of God was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that HE might destroy the work of the Divel,</hi> or <hi>that he might break the Divels head-plot in pieces:</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. He is also called, <hi>The Son of God that shall shortly bruise Sathan under our feet, Rom.</hi> 16.20. From all these places compared together, it is evident that Jesus Christ in his Divine Nature is <hi>a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet withal take notice, that the term HE in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. doth comprehend under it his Human Nature as well as his Divine; yea it doth also comprehend under it the personal union of both his Natures. First, The term HE describes him to be true man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is called <hi>the seed of the Woman.</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>condly, the term HE describes him to be true God, because <hi>he must break the Divels head-plot.</hi> Thirdly, the term HE is a Noun singular, and so it describes the Person of the Mediator to be individual, after that his two Natures were united by an Hypostatical union; and so the Apostle cals this seed of the woman, or <hi>this seed of Abraham [one]</hi> which is Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider what was his Priestly action, and that was the sprinkling of his own bloud by his own Priestly Nature, that is to say, by his Divine Nature; for <hi>he poured out his soul to death, Isa.</hi> 53.12. namely, by the active power of his own Divine Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature; for <hi>he offered himself by his Eternal Being or God-head, Heb.</hi> 9.14. that is to say, he seperated his soul from his body by the power of his God-head, when he made his soul a Trespass offering for our sins; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10. if his bloud had bin sprinkled only pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively by the hand of man, and not actively by the power of his Priestly Nature, it had made no Atonement: As for example, If the bloud of the typical sacrifice of Atonement had not bin sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Priest, it had made no Atonement, because it was an action that did properly belong to the Priests office to sprinkle the bloud of every Sacrifice upon the Altar; the Levites might not sprinkle the bloud of every sacrifice upon the Altar, the Priests only must do it: the Levites indeed might kill sacrifices, and receive the bloud in bouls, as Assistants to the Priests, but yet they might not sprinkle
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117340:54"/> the bloud of any sacrifice upon the Altar; God had reserved that action to be done by the Priests only, because it was one of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential parts of the sacrifice: See <hi>Ains.</hi> on <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Maymony</hi> saith, <hi>That the action of sprinkling bloud upon the Altar, is a weighty matter, it is the root or principal of the Sacrifice;</hi> See <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.45. as I noted it already; and the manner of sprinkling must be done with a large and liberal quantity; and therefore it is called pouring out, as I have formerly noted it in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.5. and this sprinkling with pouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut did represent the death of the beast, and also it did typifie the death of the Mediator; for the soul of the beast is in the bloud, and so also the soul or vital spirits of man is in his bloud, or with his bloud: and therefore a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bloud shed, must needs be a true evidence of death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Bloud was given or sprinkled upon the Altar to make Atonement for mens souls.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It pleased God in this respect to seperate bloud from the common use of food, as long as the partition wall of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies stood betwixt Jews and Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Therefore the Lord did threaten the Jews, that <hi>if any of them did eat bloud, that soul should be cut off from among his people: Lev.</hi> 17.11.4. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.26. But now the partition Wall is broken down, and both Jews and Gentiles may eat bloud and things strangled as lawfully as any other food.</p>
                  <p>And because this large and liberal sprinkling of bloud by the Priest upon the Altar did represent the death of the sacrifice, and typifie the death and sacrifice of Christ; therefore bloud was much used as a purging type, for almost all things are by the Law purged with bloud; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.21, 22. to signifie unto us, the purging na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christs sacrifice of Atonement: Material Bloud doth not purge, but defile; but Mediatorial Bloud doth clense and purge away sin; and therefore Christ made his oblation by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both his Natures in a Mediatorial way of obedience; his Human Nature was the Lamb without spot, and his Divine Nature was both the Priest and the Altar whereby and whereon his human Nature was sacrificed and offered; and by this means his death became a sacrifice of propitiation to procure Gods Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the true Israel of God; and in this respect his death is called <hi>the sprinkling of the bloud of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117340:54"/> speaketh better things then the bloud of Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.24.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, In this respect the Bloud of Christ is called the <hi>Bloud of God, Act.</hi> 20.28. not only because his Human Nature was united to his Divine Nature; for by the communication of properties that may be attributed to the person which is proper but to one Nature only: But secondly, It is called the Bloud of God in another respect; namely, because he shed his Bloud by his own Priestly Nature; that is to say, by the actual power of his Divine Nature; for he <hi>offered himself by his Eternal Spirit, Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>and poured out his soul to death: Isa.</hi> 53.12. In like sort he is called <hi>Iehovah our righteousness: Ier.</hi> 23. Because his Mediatorial Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (whereof his oblation was the Master-piece) was actuated by Iehovah, that is to say, by his Divine Nature as well as by his Human.</p>
                  <p>So then, I may well conclude,<note place="margin">Christ in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature was the Lamb of God without spot, and in his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was the Priest to offer it up to God as a Mediatorial Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> that the death of Christ was a Mediatorial sacrifice of Atonement, because it was the Act of the Mediator in both his Natures: In his Human Nature he was the Lamb of God without spot; and in his Divine Nature he was the Priest to offer up his Human nature to God, as a Mediatorial sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Atonement, for the procuring of his Fathers Atonement for the full Redemption of all the Elect.</p>
                  <p>But still remember my former caution, that you may understand my words with a grain of salt; for when I say he did pour out his own Bloud by the active power of his own God-head, I mean that he by the active power of his God-head did pour out his soul, or seperate his soul from his body, when he made his soul a Trespass offering for our sins and trespasses; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10.12. Bloud is often put for the seperation of his Soul from his Body; and so <hi>Isaiah</hi> doth explain it, <hi>He poured out his soul to death; Isa.</hi> 53.12. The <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers did shed a part of his Bloud, but yet all that ever they could do unto him, could not seperate his soul from his Body, till himself pleased to do that by the power of his own God-head.</p>
                  <p>His Divine nature was the Altar upon which he sanctified his Human nature, and this was typified by the Levitical Altar,<note place="margin">Christ in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature was the Altar upon which he offered his human nature as a mediatorial sacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which at the first was anointed and sanctified, that so it might sanctifie the sacrifice that was offered thereon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.1.88. for assoon as the Altar was sanctified, it was called <hi>Holiness of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; Exod.</hi> 29.37. because it sanctified all the sacrifices that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117340:55"/> were thereon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. This did teach and typifie unto us, that Christ was not only anointed and sanctified by the holy Ghost to be the mediator, but that he himself did also sanctifie his own humane nature, which he did offer up to God upon the Altar of his own God-head; as a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to God for the procuring of his Fathers Atonement for our full. Redemption. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19.</p>
                  <p>It was the holyness of his divine nature that gave the quickning power to the oblation of his humane nature. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. When Christ said to his Disciples <hi>he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him; verse</hi> 56. then many of his Disciples understood his words in a literal and corporal sense (as the Papists do, <hi>this is my body</hi>) and thereupon they were offended and said unto him, <hi>this is a hard saying, who can hear it? v.</hi> 60. that is to say, who can indure to hear of such a gross and carnal eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy body? Thereupon Iesus explained his own mind and meaning thus: <hi>it is the spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the words that I speak unto you are spirit and life, Iohn</hi> 6.63. In this answer our Saviour declareth two things. 1. That the gross and carnal substance of his flesh and blood, considered by it self alone, had no meritorious efficacy to procure our union with his person, or to procure our communion with him in his sacrifice of Atonement: neither his flesh, nor the actions of his flesh alone considered, can profit us; and therefore his Legal obedience cannot profit us; whether by way of merit, nor yet by way of imputation for our righteousness, because it is but a part of his flesh; for legal obedience is but humane obedience, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted as Mediatorial Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour in his answer declared wherein the true force and efficacy of his sacrifice did ly: namely in these two things. 1. In the personal union of his humane nature with his divine nature: 2. It lies in his priestly offering up of his humane nature by his divine nature. The flesh of Christ as it suffered death passively by the Roman Souldiers cannot profit us; but as his God-head gave the quickning power to his oblation, so it doth profit us; for by that meanes it became the meritorious procuring cause of his Farhers Atonement for our full Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when we come to the Lord Table to receive the bread
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117340:55"/> and wine, as the signes of his body broken, and of his blood shed; we must not do as the Papists do, we must not look at the gross substance of his body and blood, neither must we look at the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it in a passive manner by the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">When we come to the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we must look more at his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial oblation then at his passive death.</note> but we must look upon the bread and wine by the figure <hi>Metynomia,</hi> as the signes or tokens of his Mediatorial death; for he poured out his own soul to death by the active power of his God-head, as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement, even at the same time when his body was broken, and his blood shed in a passive manner by the Iews and Romans; I say the death of Christ must be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all faithful receivers as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement, because it was performed by the actual power of his God-head, yea by the joint concurrence of both his natures: there was not the least unwillingness in his humane nature to dy, when he came to make his soul a trespass offering for our sins; as I have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7. neither did he dy a passive death, by the power of the Roman souldiers, as the Jews thought, and as the Papists and other carnal Protestants do think; all the men and divels in the world could not put him to death by their power, I mean they could not seperate his soul from his body, till himself pleased to do it by his own priestly power, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.17.18. his soul was not seperated from his body by the sense of those pains which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man souldiers inflicted upon him, as the souls of the two thieves were that were crucified with him; for Christ dyed neither sooner nor later then the very punctual hour in which God had appointed him to make his oblation; for the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was sent to tell <hi>Daniel</hi> at the time of the evening oblation, <hi>that from that very hour to the death of Christ, should be</hi> 490. <hi>yeers</hi> exactly cut out: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and accordingly at the time of the evening sacrifice, Christ did but say, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my spirit, and at that very instant he gave up the Ghost; Mark</hi> 15.37. <hi>And when the Centurion saw that he so cryed out and gave up the Ghost,</hi> he said, <hi>truly this man was the Son of God: Mark</hi> 15.39. The Centurion did plainly see a manifest difference between the manner of Christs death and the death of the two thieves that were crucified with him; for as yet they did still continue alive in their torments, till after the time that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had begged our Saviours dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.57. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.52, 53. And that was at Sun-set; it could not be when the first evening was come, for that was at mid-day, therefore it was the latter evening of which he speaks; and that doth not begin till Sun-set, and then the two thieves were alive, and like enough they might have lived longer in their torments, if the Roman Souldiers had not broken their legs to hasten their death: but Christ was dead long before this, for he gave up the Ghost at the ninth hour, which was about 3 hours before the two thieves were killed; and for that reason the Souldiers did not break his legs, because he had bin dead three hours before, and yet by the course of his nature he might have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his torments as long as the two thieves did, for the Roman Souldiers did crucifie all three alike: what then was the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Christ died three hours before the two thieves? had he less strength of nature to bear his torments then they? or did the Roman Souldiers ad more torments upon his body then upon the two thieves? or did the Fathers wrath kill him sooner then the two thieves, as some think? surely none of all these things did ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten his death before the two thieves: but the only true reason was, because he did actuate his own death as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement (at the just hour appointed by his Father) by the joint concurrence of both his Natures: his human nature alone could not actuat his own death, because it is not in the power of any mans nature to dy when he will (except he use some sinful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against nature) neither could his God-head make his soul a Mediatorial Sacrifice, till his human nature had accomplished two things. 1. Not till he had overcome his natural fear of death, which by strange crying and tears he obtained at last; and 2. His Divine nature could not make his soul a Mediatorial Sacrifice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his human nature did put out an active willingness to dy, for his death could never have bin a Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement unless he did actuat his own death by the joint concurrence of both his natures: and therefore that act of his obedience was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster peice of all his obedience, it was the choisest thing that the Father required, or that the Mediator could perform, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cause of Gods Atonement for our full Redemption, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Adoption.</p>

And how else did he raise himself up out of his grave, but by the joint concurrence of both his natures? therefore he must needs actuate his own death by the joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of both his Natures. See a further answer to this in <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.15.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:117340:57"/>
                  <p>By this distinction imprinted upon the mind and memory, a man may easily see the reason why the death of Christ is sometimes called a passive death, and sometimes an active death.</p>
                  <p>Yea his mediatorial death may wel be called a miraculous death,<note place="margin">The death of the Mediator was a miraculos death.</note> it was no less miraculos then the raising of the dead body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was: for when Christ went about to raise the dead body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> he did but cry out to <hi>Lazarus</hi> with a loud voice, saying <hi>come forth;</hi> and <hi>at that very instant he came out of the grave: Iohn</hi> 11.43. In like manner when the just appointed hour was come wherein the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had appointed the mediator to make his soul a sacrifice for sin, he did but cry out to his Father with a loud voice, saying, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my spirit; and at that very instant he breathed out his soul into the hands of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ dyed not by degrees</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> in his <hi>Day-star) as his Saints do: his senses did not decay; no pangs of death took hold upon him; but in perfect sense, Patience, and Obedience both of body and of soul, he by his infinite power did voluntarily resign his spirit (as he was praying) into the hands of his Father, without any trembling or strugling, or without any shew of sense of his pains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Austin</hi> saith thus: <hi>who can sleep</hi> (saith he) <hi>when he will, as Christ dyed when he would? who can lay aside his Garment, so as Christ layed aside his flesh? who can leave his place, so as Christ left his life? his life was not forced from him by any imposed puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment, but he did voluntarily render it up to God as a Mediatorial Sacrifice: in his life time he was often touched with the fear of death, but by his strong crying unto God with dayly prayers and tears, he obtained power against his natural fear o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And it is further evident that his death was miraculous, by the speech of the Centurion, for when he saw that Christ did but cry out and give up the Ghost, at the same instant he said, <hi>truly this man was the Son of God; Mark</hi> 15.39.</p>
                  <p>Again it is evident that his death was miraculous, because at that instant when he breathed out his soul into the hands of God, <hi>the vail of the temple</hi> (which typified his human nature) <hi>rent it self in twain from the top to the bottom; and at that time</hi> also <hi>the graves of the Saints did open themselves, and many of the dead Saints did arise: Mat.</hi> 27.51.

                  <p>Hence we may learn, that the doctrine of the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> in their Transubstantiation, and in Ctheir onsubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very erroneous; for they place the meritorious price of their redemption in the gross substance of Christs flesh and bloud, and in the passive shedding of it upon the cross by the Romans; and they also do make the wooden cross on which Christ was crucified as a malefactor, to be the Altar; they may as wel make the Roman souldiers to be the priests that did offer up his human nature in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for our redemption: O woful blindness, that they should thus corrupt the meritorious price of our Atonement and redemption!</p>
                  <p>But I have formerly confuted this carnal and superstitious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: I have formerly proved that the God-head of Christ was the Altar, and that the God-head of Christ was the priest whereby he made his mediatorial sacrifice of Atonement: I have shewed that neither the substance of Christs flesh, nor the substance of his bloud, nor the passive action of sheding it by the Roman souldiers, could make his death to be a mediatorial sacrifice: and so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told the Iews when they understood him of eating the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his flesh, and of drinking the substance of his bloud; he told them plainly, that it was not his flesh nor his bloud, but the Spirit or God-head that gave the quickning vertue to his flesh and bloud: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. It is a gross conceit to think that the substance of bloud can clense any mans soul, for the gross substance of bloud doth defile, and in that respect it was counted unclean: <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.26.</p>
                  <p>But the clensing vertue of his bloud lies in his own mediatorial sheding of it, for though he did not break his own body, and pour out his own bloud with nails and spear as the Roman souldiers did,<note place="margin">Christ did actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake his own body in pieces, when he did seperate his soul from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy▪ and he did actually pour out his own life when he poured out his soul to death.</note> yet he brake his own body in pieces, by seperating his own soul from his body by the power of his divine nature: and then he did actually shed his own bloud, when he did pour out his own soul to death; <hi>Is.</hi> 53.12. as a mediatorial sacrifice of Atonement, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his Fathers Atonement for our full redemption, justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on▪ and Adoption: and in this sense only <hi>the bloud of Christ doth purge us; Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>And clense us;</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>and wash us from our sins.

               <p>But the truth is, they are greatly deceived, for the ten Com̄and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do require faith in Christ as wel as moral duties: but faith in Christ was not engraven in <hi>Adams</hi> nature in the time of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, he knew nothing concerning saith in Christ til after his fal, therefore the ten Com̄andments (in the full latitude of them) were not given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, they were not given till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ was published to be <hi>the seed of the woman, to break the Divels head-plot.</hi> Therefore the ten Commandments do require faith in Christ as well as moral duties.</p>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:117340:59"/> saith that <hi>there is no precept in all the Bible, but it must come within the compass of one or other of the ten commandments,</hi> and in this sense our Saivor affirmed to the Scribes that there are but <hi>two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in the Law,</hi> (which are the first Table and the Second) and that <hi>on these two commandments do hang the whole Law and the Prophets, Mat.</hi> 22.40. Hence I reason thus, if the whole Law and the Prophets do hang upon the ten Commandments, as the general heads of all that is contained within the Law and Prophets, then the ten commandments must needs containe in them rules of faith in Christ as wel as moral duties.</p>
               <p>And this is further evident by the preface of the ten com̄andments which runs thus, <hi>I am Iehovah thy God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> hence it may be demanded who that <hi>Iehovah</hi> was that brought them out of the Land of Egypt? whether was it the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost? the answer is, that though the term <hi>Iehovah</hi> be common to all the three persons, yet in this place it must be applyed to Iesus Christ especially (not excluding the other persons) he is often called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.7. doth expound <hi>Deu.</hi> 6.16. and HE is that <hi>Iehovah</hi> that brought them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> He it was that first appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Bush,</hi> and that sent <hi>Moses</hi> unto <hi>Pharoah</hi> with miraculous power to bring his people out of <hi>Egypt, Ex.</hi> 3.2. At the first he is called <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Iehovah,</hi> (the Father) <hi>v.</hi> 2. But in <hi>v.</hi> 6. He is called, <hi>the God of Abraham;</hi> and after this he was called <hi>the Angel of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence that went before his people in the wilderness; Ex.</hi> 23.20. and he is also called <hi>the Angel that brought them out of Egypt; Num.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Ex.</hi> 14.19. He is that Angel that spake to <hi>Moses</hi> in mount <hi>Sinai, Acts</hi> 7.38. and he is also called <hi>Iehovah, that went before them in a pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night: Ex.</hi> 13.21. And the Hebrew Doctors do acknowledge that their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Egypt was <hi>by the hand of the Angel the Redeemer, with the power of the great God;</hi> as it is said in <hi>Ex.</hi> 32.11. see also <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.17.</p>
               <p>From all these places compared together, it is evident that Christ was that <hi>Iehovah</hi> that brought them out of the Land of Egypt, and that gave them the ten commandments on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that it was HE that spake unto them, whose voice then sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:117340:59"/>
               <p>Therefore it was Christ that gave the first Commandment say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods but me, Ex.</hi> 20.3. That is to say, thou shalt have none other Gods but the Trinity, and no other Mediator but me alone to be thy Redeemer and Saviour: <hi>for there is no other name given under heaven by which we can saved: Acts</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p>In like sort Christ in the 2 Commandment doth require obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all his outward worship, and in speciall to all his Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal worship, for that was the present outward worship which he commanded at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> immediatly after he had given them the ten commandments: and the observation of that worship is especially called <hi>the Law of VVorks</hi> (though the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must also be included) but the right application of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical signification of the levitical worship to the soul, is called <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> or the Gospel part of the Law, for all their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical worship was given on purpose to guide their souls to Christ; therefore faith in Christ must needs be comprised typically under the second commandment: the Tabernacle, the Ark, the Altar, and the Sacrifices, whose blood was sprinkled upon the Altar by the Priest, did teach and typifie how the mediator should make our Atonement by his Mediatorial Sacrifice, all this and much more is comprised under that outward worship, which is command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by the second Commandment.</p>
               <p>The 3 Commandment doth teach holy Reverence to the person of the mediator, because it commandeth reverence to his sanctuary, where his divine nature did reside in the cloud of his presence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mercy-seat: <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith in Christ is also typically comprehended under the 4 Commandment, for the Sabbath was not ordained til after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, nor till he was convinced of his sin, nor til the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was promised to break the Divels head-plot; for <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the very same sixt day in which he was created, and in that very day the Lord did effectually convince him of his miserable condition by his disobediont eating of the forbidden fruit: and in that day also the Lord in great Mercy did set before him an effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by promising to him that <hi>the seed of the woman should break the divels head-plot:</hi> and so through the mighty operation of God, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> were inabled to believe their Atonement through
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:117340:60"/> the mediation of the promised seed; and so by that meanes <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> that were before dead in corruption and sin, were made alive again through grace; and so the whole creation was made new, perfected and finished by the Redemption in the evening of the sixt day, and then on the seventh day God rested from all his works, because he rested in the Mediator for the perfecting of the creation by the redemption of the promised seed, and he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam</hi> to rest on that day both bodily and spiritually. 1. Bodily, from all bodily labor, that so he might spend the whole day in Gods outward worship; 2. That he might rest spiritually, by causing his faith to rest upon the promised seed for his ful redemption: and thus God ordained the first Sabbath that ever was, to be observ'd both as a sanctified sign of resting on Christ, and also as a Sanctified time to be wholy spent in Gods worship, and as a help to us to meditate on our redemption by the promised seed.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows by good and necessary consequence from the promises.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ten commandments do containe in them rules of Faith in Christ as well as moral rules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it is evident that the term moral law, is not a sutable title for the ten commandments; because it doth not sufficiently comprehend under it the scope of the ten commandments, which every general title ought to do.</p>
               <p>The Title which our saviour puts upon them is, the two great Commandments on which the whole Law and Prophets do hang: But the most usual fit title is the Ten commandments.</p>

               <p>I cannot see how the Common Doctrine of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can stand with Gods justice: God cannot in justice impute our Saviours legal obedience to us, for our justice, righteousness or justificati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Namely that man that doth personally observe the whole law by his own natureal power shall live thereby: and thus the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth explain the meaning of the Legal condition in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The law is not of faith, but the man that doth them shal live in them;</hi> he doth plainly exclude faith and such like supernatural helps, as being no part of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the legal promise, therefore it requires every singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to perform it by his own natural power; and this is further evident by the curse that is added to <hi>every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. The curse of the law runs thus, if any singular person doth faile but once in the course of his life, though it be but in the least circumstance, he must by the justice of the law be eternally cursed: he and no other for him must dy eternally: therefore he and no other for him must keep the whole law if ever he doth look to be justified in Gods sight by legal righteousness: and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by good consequence, that God cannot in justice justifie any man by imputing to him Christs legal obedience for his justice.</p>

               </p>
               <p>First, Some affirm that God the Father doth impute Christs legal obedience to sinners as their obedience for their ful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect justification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others do affirm that Christs legal obedience impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not sufficient of it self to make a sinner perfectly righteous; and therefore they affirm that God doth impute another kind of Christs righteousness to sinners for their full justification, namely the purity of his nature in his conception and birth, to justifie us from our original sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Others go further in the point of imputation, for they do affirm that God doth impute another kind of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to sinners for their full justification, namely his passive obedience, and so by necessary consequence they do make sinners to be their own mediators, because they do make Christs media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial obedience to be a sinners obedience by Gods imputation: but I have confuted this kind of imputation in a particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about it in the close of this Treatise.</p>
               <p>Many such like absurd consequences as these, do often follow at the heels of the common doctrine of imputation: but against, all these ways of imputation, I may well frame this Argument.</p>
               <p>The Actions of Christs obedience, neither active nor passive, can be made ours by Gods imputation, no more then our sinful actions can be made his by Gods imputation.</p>
               <q>But our sinful actions cannot be made his by Gods Imputation as I have at large proved in the opening of <bibl>

               <p>First, God appointed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Mediator to fulfil the Law of VVorks, I mean so much of it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sell within the compass of his human course of life, not as a proper condition belonging to the Law of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-ship (as Mediator) but as true man only, for he was bound to observe the Law of VVorks as he was true man, as much as any other Jew by a native right, as the Apostle sheweth in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and the Law of VVorks doth require every Jew to observe it by his own natural power, without any supernatural help from God; therefore Christs legal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bedience cannot be accounted as a part of his mediatorial obedience; for nothing can be accounted as a part of his mediatorial obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce, but that which he did actuate by the joynt concurrence of both his natures.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:117340:62"/>
               <p>Secondly, Though I do make his Legal Obedience to be no more but human obedience, yet I grant that he was thereby qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and fitted to make his soul a mediatorial Sacrifice; for he could not have bin the Lamb of God without spot, if he had not bin exact in the performance of so much legal obedience as fell within the compass of his human course of life; See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The rewards which his Father did promise unto him for his Mediatorial Obedience, do far exceed the rewards which he doth promise to legal obedience; for I cannot find that ever the Father did promise to reward any mans legal Obedience with such special rewards as he doth promise unto Christs mediatorial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>I will give thee the ends of the earth for thy possession,</hi> Ps. 2. and <hi>He shall see his seed and prolong his days, when he shall make his soul a Trespass offering:</hi> Isa. 53.10.

               <p>Fourthly, Christ was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t bound to fulfil personal obedience to every branch of the Law of works (for he had not wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to instruct, &amp;c.) but he was bound to fulfil every branch and circumstance of the law of Mediatorship, he must not be wanting in the least circumstance thereof; if he had bin wanting in the least circumstance, he had bin wanting in all.</p>

                  <hi>that some of the actions of Christ were proper to his God-head only, and some of his actions were proper to his human nature only, and some of his actions were common to both his Natures: and this observation</hi> (saith M. <hi>Calvin) shall do us no small service to assoyl many doubts, if the Reader can but fitly apply it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is absurd to affirm that all the Acts of Christs Obedience were Mediatorial, because his person consisted of two Natures; for then his natural actions should be mediatorial as well as any other; you may as well say that all the actions of the Son and of the holy Ghost are the actions of the Father, because they are united into one God-head, as say that the acts of Christs legal obedience were mediatorial, because his person consisted of two natures; but as the actions of each person in Trinity must often be distinguished from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117340:63"/> each other in the manner of their working, so must the acts of Christs obedience be distinguished, either according to his divine nature, or according to his human nature, or according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal union of both his natures; for sometimes his natures do work severally, and sometimes jointly.</p>
               <p>As for example, all the actions of Christ from his birth until he began to be thirty years of age, must be considered but as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or but as legal acts of obedience; for till he began to be thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers of age, he lived a private life with his Parents, and was subject to them, and learned the Trade of a Carpenter of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joseph;</hi> and in that respect he was som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Secondly when he began to be 30 yeers of age, he did then begin to declare himself to be the mediator; for when he was baptized of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Iordan,</hi> the holy Ghost did light upon him in a visible manner, before all <hi>Iohns</hi> auditory, and then the Father by his voice from heaven declared that he was the mediator <hi>in whom he was wel pleased</hi> and immediatly upon this <hi>he was led aside from thence</hi> (by the holy Spirit) <hi>into the wilderness to be tempted and tryed by the divel,</hi> whether he would be a faithful Mediator or no: <hi>and he continued in the wild<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rness in fasting and prayer for forty dayes together,</hi> that he might be able by his Mediatorial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to breake the divels head-plot in peices: and after this the Father did again anoint him by the Holy Ghost in the time of his transfiguration, for the better inabling him to accomplish his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial oblation at Jerusalem; <hi>Luke</hi> 9.31. and after he was instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the mediators office at his baptism, he did freely and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall to preaching in their Synagogues, which was the act of his human nature, but yet it was often accompanied with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of his God-head; and this was done to declare his person to be the person of the mediator, and therefore he did not only heal the sick, but also he forgave sins.</p>
               <p>This was the progress of the mediator after that he was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117340:63"/> installed into his office at his baptism, when he began to be thirty yeers of age.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the upshot of his life, as soon as he had fulfilled all things that were written of him, he sanctified himself, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his oblation by the joint concurrence of both his natures: and this was the Master-peice of all his mediatorial obedience.</p>
               <p>Having thus distinguished the actions of the mediator according to each of his natures, or according to the personal union of both his natures, we may and must rank his acts of obedience accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; his obedience to the law of VVorks must be ranked among the actions of his humane nature, and his obedience to the law of mediator-ship must be ranked among his mediatorial actions which he performed by the personal union of both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by this rule of distinction, I can find no other place for his legal obedience but among his humane acts of obedience; for as he was true man he was made unto the law of VVorks as much as any other Jew was, and therefore he must observe it by his human power.</p>

               <p>But he did not publikely take upon him to do the office of a mediator until the Father did publikely instal him into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators office when he began to be thirty yeers of age, and then as he was baptized before all <hi>Iohns</hi> auditory, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It may be you think (as many others do) that Christ began to pay the price of our redemption from the very first beginning of his incarnation, for many affirm that he was conceived by the holy Ghost without any original sin, that so he might thereby justifie us from our original sin; which opinion I have confuted: but the open History of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> do speak nothing at all of any of his mediatorial actions till he was publikely installed into the office of the mediator at <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism; and truly his abstaining so long from the doing of any publike mediatorial action, was not without a divine mistery; for the Priests in the Law might not enter into their office to do the publike actions of a Priest, until they began to be thirty yeers of age <hi>Num</hi> 4.47. In like sort the Father did not instal the mediator to do the publike office of the mediator, until that very age; and then <hi>the Father did anoint him with the holy Ghost; Mat.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17.

               <p>These two terms, first <hi>our desire,</hi> secondly <hi>our fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all righteousness,</hi> had need to be explained.</p>
               <p>First the term <hi>Ʋs,</hi> or <hi>our desire,</hi> cannot be meant of the joint desire of <hi>Iohn</hi> with Christs desire, for it is plain by the text that <hi>Iohn</hi> did not desire to baptize Christ according to Christs desire; because he earnestly <hi>put him back and forbade him at the present:</hi> therefore the term <hi>our desire</hi> must have relation to some others, namely to the joint desire of all the Trinity; for it was now the joint desire of all the Trinity to instal the Mediator publikely into his office: and the Father had foretold <hi>Iohn</hi> how he should know the person that should be installed to baptize with the holy Ghost
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117340:64"/> and fire; saying, <hi>upon whom thou shalt see the spirit come down and tarry still upon him, that is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost: Iohn</hi> 1.33. by this foretelling, <hi>Iohn</hi> might easily understand Christ to mean the Trinity by the term <hi>our.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is further evident that it was the desire of all the Trinity to instal the mediator publikely before all <hi>Iohns</hi> Auditory then present. First because the holy Ghost did light upon him in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible shape of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and secondly, because the Son came and stood forth before all that Auditory and accepted that office; and thirdly, because the Father by his voice from heaven did openly testifie that <hi>he was his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second word of the latter sentence to be explained is this, what is meant by the word <hi>Righteousness</hi> which all the Trinity did now desire to fulfil? The answer is, that they desired to fulfil all that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which appertained to the Mediators person and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, at this time they desired to fulfil that part of righteousness which appertained to his publike instalment; for he might not do the office of the Mediator till he was publikely installed.</p>
               <p>From the time of his birth hitherto, he did not heal infirmitys, nor forgive sins, neither did he prove his person to be the person of the Mediator by any miracles of his God-head: but as soon as he was publikely installed, then he left his dwelling at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and removed his dwelling to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> for there he must first begin to shew forth the light of his person and office to them of <hi>Galilee,</hi> to fulfil that light which <hi>Esay</hi> foretold should arise in <hi>Galilee, Mat.</hi> 4.13, 14. And from that time forth he did openly declare himself to be the Mediator; saying, <hi>the spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath anointed me; Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>Psa.</hi> 45. And so he did for three yeers and a halfe together prove himself to be the Mediator by the works of his God-head; and at last he finished his mediatorial oblation as the Master-peice of all his obedience, and then God did more especially declare him to be the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> by the manner of his death, which was miraculous, and exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the sight of God for the procuring of his Atonement for all believing sinners.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Question 2. <hi>How did God send him for sin? and how did he condemne sin in the flesh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> God sent him for sin, when he sent him to make his soul <hi>a sacrifice of atonement for sin,</hi> as I have opened the phrase at large in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. In the first part.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:117340:65"/>
               <p>And he <hi>condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> when he made his flesh or human nature a sacrifice of Atonement for sin; for by that means he procured his Fathers Atonement to all believing Sinners: and therefore <hi>there is no condemnation to such sinners. v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>In briefe the meaning of the Apostle lies thus, when God sent his Son to dy as a malefactor in the Similitude of sinful flesh, Christ did at the same time condemn sin, because he did at the same time dy as a mediator and made his soul a mediatorial Sacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for sin; and so he procured his Fathers Atonement to poor sinners: and by this means he condemned sin in the flesh, and made sinners sinless, that is to say righteous.</p>
               <p>But this distinction of the double death of Christ I have opened more at large in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. and in <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.15.</p>
               <p>Then in v. 4. the Apostle makes application of all this unto us that are in Christ, saying,<note place="margin">How sinners are made righteous by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law.</note>
                  <hi>that the righteousness of the law</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that righteousness which was taught and typified in the Law by their sacrifices of Atonement) <hi>might be fulfilled in us:</hi> for the burnt offerings, Sin offerings, and Trespass offerings, did teach and typify to poor believing sinners how they must be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, namely by Gods Atonement; which must be obtained and procured by Christ media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orial Sacrifice of Atonement; there is no other way or means to make a sinner righteous but this way; and in this sense the ceremonial law taught sinners (except wilful sinners) how they might be made righteous or sinless: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as soon as ever any sinner had accomplished his sacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement he was by the Law accounted a righteous person in Gods sight, and such persons might freely come to the Sanctuary, and feast there before <hi>Iehovah</hi> with rejoycing and with accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</p>
               <p>And in this very sense all sacrifices of Atonement are called sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Righteousnes; as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Ps.</hi> 51.19.<note place="margin">Why sacrifices of atonement are called sacrifices of Righteousness.</note> But these sacrifices of Righteousness <hi>were but shaddows of good things to come: Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God, Heb.</hi> 7.19.

Answ.</hi> By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his own soul a <hi>Trespass</hi> and a <hi>Sin-offering:</hi> by that means he finished the ceremonial use of all Trespass offerings, and ended the ceremonial use of all sin offerings: and this he accomplished by his death just 490 yeers after the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> had done this message to <hi>Daniel: He took away the first sacrifices of the Law, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own sacrifice in the place of them for ever. Heb.</hi> 10.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>How did Christ bring in everlasting Righteousness? Answ.</hi> By the same way and means by which he made reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for unri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> told <hi>Daniel,</hi> that he should do it <hi>by finishing all Trespass offerings, and by ending all Sin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when he made his own soul a Burnt offering and a Sin offering once for all.

               <p>Thirdly, The new Testament doth also bear witness to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; 1. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle doth tell us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. that <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law</hi> (namely that righteousness which was taught and typified by the sacrifices of the Law) <hi>might be fulfilled in us, that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit:</hi> as I have explained this Text a little before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth in another place confirm this doctrine, saying, <hi>God made him to be sin for us</hi> (that is to say, God ordained him to be a sacrifice of Atonement for our sins) <hi>that we might be made the righteousness of God in him;</hi> that is to say, that we might be made righteous or sinless by Gods Atonement, which a sinner receives assoon as he is in him, namely assoon as he is in Christ by faith, for all spiritual blessings do c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed seed should redeem his people; they were all preachers of justice or righteousness as well as <hi>Noah,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117340:70"/> and therefore of old time they had not only Prophets, but divers other learned men also, that did every Sabbath preach the Gospel in every City, that is to say, in every Synagogue or School, which were plentifully erected in every City; <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. and with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.35.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This doctrine of a sinners justification and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the promised seed, was daily and familiarly explained unto them by several sacrifices of Atonement, by which they saw (as in a glass) how the Mediator by his sacrifice of Atonement should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Fathers Atonement for their full and perfect redemption and justification.</p>
               <p>And thus after this manner <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Fathers and faithful (from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) knew as well as we do now (and I think better also, because the common doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation did not blind their eys as it doth ours) how Christ should make his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And because <hi>Abraham believed</hi> all this, both in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.31. and again in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. therefore <hi>God imputed that Faith to him for righteousness;</hi> for by that faith he apprehended and rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and applyed it to his own soul as an effectual remedy to acquit him from the guilt of all his sins; and so by that means he became sinless, that is to say, just and righteous in Gods sight.</p>
               <p>And in this sense the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth prove that <hi>Abrahams Faith was accounted to him for righteousnes,</hi> by a testimony taken from <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Ps.</hi> 32. saying, even as <hi>David</hi> also describeth the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness of that man unto whom God imputeth <hi>Righteousnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works,</hi> saying, <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are Forgiven, and whose sins are covered: Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute sin: Came this blessednes upon the Circumcision only?</hi> No, it comes upon any other Country-men as well as upon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, if they have but faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> had to apprehend and receive the Fathers atonement; by which means their sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, covered, and not imputed.</p>
               <p>VVhat other reason can any man else render why the Apostle should interlace this testimony in this place, but to describe unto us the true manner how <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith did make him rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117340:71"/> namely because by his faith he did apprehend and receive the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers atonement, by which his sins were forgiven, covered, and not imputed.</p>
               <p>And thus after this sort the Apostle doth bring in forgiveness of sins, as an effect of justifying faith; for faith is the only instrument of the Spirit, by which sinners come to be united to the Mediator, in and through whose mediation they apprehend and receive the Fathers atonement, pardon, and forgiveness, for their full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect justification.</p>
               <p>This was the only true reason why God imputed <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith to him for righteousness, namely, because he believed in Gods atonement through the mediation of the seed promised.</p>
               <p>And it is further evident that this doctrine of a sinners righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by faith, was taught and preached by all the Prophets, as <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth; for <hi>all the Prophets</hi> (saith he) <hi>do witnes that through the name of Christ whosoever believeth in him shall receive remissi- of their sins: Acts</hi> 10.43.35. that is to say, they shall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sins for their justification by the Fathers atonement, procured by Christs sacrifice of atonement.</p>
               <p>From all the premises I conclude, that a sinner is justified by faith, no otherwise but as faith is that grace of the spirit whereby a sinner is enabled to apprehend and receive the Fathers merciful atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which their sins are forgiven, covered, and not imputed: and because <hi>Abraham</hi> did thus apprehend and receive the Fathers atonement by faith, through the mediation of the seed promised, therefore God did impute that faith to him for his righteousness.</p>
               <p>And to this Tenor the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth explain the use of faith in the point of a sinners Justification, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.6.10. <hi>with the heart</hi> (saith he) <hi>man believeth unto righteousness;</hi> he doth not say that faith is a sinners righteousness, but that by it a sinner believeth unto righteousness.</p>
               <p>And in this sense all sacrifices of atonement are called sacrifices of righteousness, not only as they are the procuring cause of the Fathers atonement for a sinners righteousness, but al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it is further evident that faith doth no otherwise justifie a sinner but as it is that grace or instrument of the spirit whereby a sinner is inabled to apprehend and receive the Fathers atonement, by the Apostles discourse in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23, 24, 25. all which verses I will briefly expound unto you.</p>

Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Psa.</hi> 71.2.15, 16.19.24. God there calls it his righteousness; and in <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.142. <hi>Yea all their righteousness is of me saith the Lord: Is.</hi> 54.17. And when God sent the mediator of this righteousnes into the world, he saith <hi>that righteousness did look down from heaven Ps.</hi> 85.11. and yet also this righteousness of God is sometimes called a sinners righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, because God the Father doth make it to be a sinners own righteousness as soon as they can get faith to apprehend it and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:117340:72"/> apply it to their own souls, as the next verse doth declare.</p>
               <p>But yet the Apostle doth further describe this righteousness of God in 21. verse, by two other circumstances 1. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gatively 2. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively. 1. Negatively, he saith that <hi>this righteousness is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the workes of the Law;</hi> he doth plainly affirm that the works of the Law have no influence at all in the point of a sinners justice or justification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth affirm that this righteousness of God whereby sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are made righteous, is <hi>such a righteousness as is witnessed by the Law and by the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>witnessed by the Law;</hi> namely by that part of the Law which did teach and typifie unto sinners how they might be made sinless by Gods Atonement, through their sacrifices of atonement, as the procuring cause thereof: as I have opened the matter more at large already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This doctrine of a sinners righteousness by Gods merciful atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>is witnessed by the Prophets,</hi> as I have already declared in verse 22. <hi>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith in Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all that do believe: for their is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these words the Apostle doth declare the instrumental cause or meanes how and after what manner the righteousness of God doth come to be a sinners righteousness; namely by faith in Iesus Christ. 2. He declares the extent of this righteousnes (in the next clause) <hi>unto all, and upon all that do believe, whether they be Iews or Gentils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doth not say that faith is their righteousness: but that the righteousness of God is theirs by faith: <hi>with the heart man believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto righteousness. Rom.</hi> 10.10. Faith is the way, or it is the instrumental meanes whereby sinners do receive Gods mercyful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for their full and perfect righteousness; for as soon as a poor humbled sinner doth believe in Christ, and in his mediatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sacrifice of atonement, he cannot chuse but believe in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mercyful atonement, Pardon, and Forgiveness, which is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ful and perfect righteousness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The true manner how the law taught sinners to get righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a poor humbled sinner brought his sacrifice of atonement to the priest to be offered for him upon the Altar: <hi>he must lay both his hands withall his might upon the head of his sacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> this kind of imposition was ordained by God, to teach and typifie unto sinners how they must by faith rest and depend upon the sacrifice of Christ, as the only meritorious procuring cause of the Fathers atonement for their full and perfect righteousness.</p>
               <p>And no mans sacrifice of Atonement did make atonement for him without this imposition, as I have explained the matter in the first part; this act of imposition was a necessary typical action, for it did typify unto sinners, that if they desired to obtain the Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, they must receive it and apply it to their own souls by their faith of dependance upon the mediators sacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the meritorious procuring cause thereof: And thus after this sort the righteousness of God by faith in Jesus Christ was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by the law.</p>
               <p>V. 24. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace through the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in Iesus Christ:</hi> in the words the the Apostle laies down the efficient cause of a sinners righteousness or justification, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the principal efficient cause of the meritorious procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cause of our justification, <hi>through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the free grace and mercy of God in himself that moved him to ordain Iesus Christ to be the meritorious procuring cause of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:117340:73"/> our redemption: and therefore also it must needs proceed from his free grace in himself that he doth justifie sinners, or make them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by his mercyful atonement, pardon and forgivenes.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>it pleaseth the Father (of his free grace) to reconcile all things to himself (even) by Iesus Christ Col,</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>Whom God hath fore-ordained to be a propitiation (or a sacrifice of Atonement) through faith in his bloud:</hi> by his bloud is meant his sacrifice of Atonement, and by faith in his bloud is meant that grace or instrument of the spirit whereby sinners do rest upon Christs sacrifice of Atonement as the procuring cause of Gods atonement for their justification: the Apostle explaines the matter by another sentence in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>by whom we have received the Atonement:</hi> the Apostle doth imply three things in this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. 1. That Christ is the mediator by whom sinners do receive. 2. that the main thing which they do receive by him, is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Atonement. 3. That the means or instrument by which they do receive the Fathers atonement, is the grace of faith; that is the only hand by which the spirit doth inable sinners to receive the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers atonement for their full and perfect justification.</p>
               <p>V. 25. <hi>To declare his rghteousness by passing over sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that are past, through the forbearance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God declared his righteousnes towards sinners by ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iesus Christ to be a propitiation. 2. By ordaining the grace of faith as the instrument of the spirit whereby poor sinners might be inabled to believe in the mediators propitiatory sacrifice, and to receive through him the Fathers atonements for their righteousnes: 3. By passing over sins that are past: this phrase may well allude to Gods atonement when he sent his Angel to pass over the Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites houses through the bloud of the Paschal Lamb, which was sprinkled upon their door posts for the procuring of Gods atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that so Gods destroying Angel might not kill them, as he did the Egyptians,</p>
               <p>And in this sense <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet said unto penitent <hi>David: the Lord hath also passed over thy sins, thou shalt not dy:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. And thus God passed over his sins that were past, through the forbearance of God: and this title of Gods forbearance or long suffering, is one of the attributes of his atonement to poor believing sinners, in <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.6. and in this sense also <hi>David</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:117340:73"/> unto the Father; saying, <hi>I beseech thee O Lord, pass over the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 21.8. and thus <hi>Iob</hi> prayed to the Father saying, <hi>why dost thou not bear my transgression, and pass over mine iniquity? Iob</hi> 7.21</p>
               <p>Hence it may be concluded, that Gods atonement doth properly respect sins that are past; and therefore as often as Gods people do fall into sin, they must labor to renew their atonement with God: God will have his people to labor for his atonement every day, because they fall into sin every day: and therefore justified persons have need of new justice to their consciences every day; <hi>Ps.</hi> 130.3, 4. <hi>and</hi> 143.2. <hi>and</hi> 51.2.7. And then the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever: <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
               <p>And sundry uses of consolation do belong to all justified persons, First <hi>they are blessed,</hi> Ps. 32.1, 2. Secondly, <hi>they must rejoyce in that condition,</hi> Ps. 32.11. Thirdly, <hi>there is a reward due to such after their hard tryals,</hi> Jam. 3.18. Fourthly, <hi>the Lord upholdeth them,</hi> Ps. 37.25. Fiftly, <hi>they shall inherit the heavenly Canaan,</hi> Ps. 37.29. Sixtly, <hi>the Lord will bless them with favorable acceptation,</hi> Ps. 5.12. Seventhly <hi>the Lord will hear them when they cry,</hi> Ps. 34.15. Eightly, <hi>blessed are they that hunger and thirst after this righteousness, for they shall be filled.</hi> Mat. 5.6.</p>
               <p>And now for a conclusion I will sum up the doctrine of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into six heads:</p>
               <p>First, The Subject matter of Justification is, <hi>Believing sinners of all sorts, both Iews and Gentiles all the world over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Formal cause of Justification, or of a Sinners Righteousness is, <hi>The Fathers Atonement, Pardon, and Forgivenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The meritorious procuring cause of the Fathers atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a sinners Justification is, <hi>Christs Mediatorial Sacrifice of Atonement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The next Instrumental means by which a sinner doth receive and apprehend the Fathers Atonement for his Justification is, <hi>Faith in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, The only efficient cause of all the former Causes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is, <hi>Gods free grace and mercy in himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, The End of all is, <hi>The glory of Gods free grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the believing sinners Justification and Salvation.</hi>

               <p>The Apostle saith, <hi>that Christ was made of God unto us righteousnes,</hi> But how? not as the Doctrine of Imputation speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but thus, God made him to be our righteousnes in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial way, by ordaining him to be the only meritorious procuring cause of his atonement, which is a sinners only righteousnes: Christ is not a sinners righteousnes any otherwise but in a mediatorial way only, as I have often warned.</p>
               <p>Christ is called <hi>Iehovah our Righteousness;</hi> but still it must be understood in a mediatorial way, and no otherwise:</p>

So also Christ is called <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> that is to say, <hi>King of righteousnes, and King of Peace; Heb.</hi> 7.2. but still it must be understood in a mediatorial way; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, The Father is a sinners righteousness, 1. Efficiently, 2. Formally. 1.

               <p>Although your author doth labour to confute the common Doctrine of imputation by Christs active obedience to the law of works, yet he doth labor to maintain the same doctrine of imputation of Christs passive obedience, which is as much erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious from the truth at the other: your author doth affirm that sinners are made righteous by the passive obedience of Christ imputed, but he is put to his shifts to declare it, by a distinction between Christ as he was our Lamb for sacrifice in his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as he was our priest in his divine nature, for else he did foresee that he should run into an exceeding gross absurdity if he had made any action of Christs God-head or Priestly nature to

               <p n="2">2. His distinction between Christ as he was our Lamb for sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in his human nature, and as he is our Priest in his divine nature, is very ill applyed, because he makes Christs passive obedience to be meritorious and satisfactory, excluding him as he is our Priest: But the truth is, his Priestly nature and action must not be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his Passive action in his Human nature, they were united as one in the making of his mediatorial sacrifice: therefore I will take occasion hereby once again to declare unto you the efficacy of Christs mediatorial oblation in both his natures, both as he was the Lamb of God, and as he was the Priest.</p>
               <p>First, It was a chief part of Christs mediatorial obedience, in that he did assume and take the seed of the woman into the unity of his God-head; by which action he declared himself to be the Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Christ is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause of his Fathers atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners not only as he is our sacrifice but also as he is our Priest</note>Secondly, Hence it follows, that his passive obedience in his human nature, could not have bin accounted or accepted of God as a mediatorial oblation, if it had not bin offered by his divine Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature; Therefore whole Christ in both his natures must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in his oblation as the meritorious procuring cause of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Atonement, not only as he was the Lamb for sacrifice, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as he was our Priest; and this is evident by comparing the type with the anti-type.</p>
               <p>First, The high Priest under the Law was a type of the Priestly nature of Christ, and by his Priestly appearing before <hi>Iehovah,</hi> he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:117340:76"/> made daily atonement for <hi>all Israel,</hi> namely by appearing before <hi>Iehovah</hi> in his Priestly Habit, for he came before <hi>Iehovah</hi> with a golden plate upon his fore-head, wherein was engraven <hi>Holiness to Iehovah,</hi> that so by that means he might <hi>Bear away the iniquity of the holy things of the Sons of Israel, and procure their favorable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation before Iehovah: Exod.</hi> 28.36, 37, 38.

               <p>By the one sort they made atonement for the people with the bloud of their sin-offering, and by the other sort they made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the people without bloud; for none of the bloud ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>of was carryed into the holy place; <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.30. but the Priests did make atonement for the people only by their Priestly appearing and by their Priestly eating it before <hi>Iehovah, Lev.</hi> 6.25, 26, 27, 28, 29. for the Priests by their Priestly appearing and eating it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iehovah</hi> in the holy place, did bear or take away the peoples, sins: <hi>See Ains. in Lev.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>Solomon Jarcy</hi> saith, <hi>That the Priests were they that did eat, and the Owners were they that had the Atonement.</hi> And thus the Priests were ordained to be mediators between God and the People. They were ordained by God,<note place="margin">The Levitticall priests were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators.</note> and yet they were taken from among men, that they might be touched with their infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.4. therefore the Priests had an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in both parties; they were for God to the people, and they were for the people to God; for a mediator is not a mediator of one, but he must mediate between two parties: Therefore the Priests must eat the peoples sin-offering in the holy place, to signifie their double interest and communion with both parties, both with God and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:117340:77"/> with the people; for eating with any signifies communion, as it is demonstrated by <hi>Peters</hi> vision of eating, <hi>he heard a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven saying, Arise Peter, kill and eat;</hi> namely, kill and eat such beasts and fowls at were counted unclean by the Law; which was done to signifie unto him, that he must go to <hi>Cornelius</hi> house and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who was an unclean Heathen, and have familiar converse and communion with him by eating, see <hi>Acts</hi> 10.13, 14, 15.28. Hence I infer, that when the Priests did eat the peoples sin-offering in the holy place, they had communion both with <hi>Iehovah</hi> and with the people in eating their sacrifice, and so they were mediators for the peoples atonement; and this must needs typifie the double interest of the Mediator, which he had in his Priestly nature both with God and with all the Elect, for the procuring of Gods atonement for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ by his Priestly prayers, or mediatorial prayers, procured Gods Atonement for all the Elect (even before his death) as well as by his bloudy oblation; and this was typified by the sweet Incense which the Priests must burn dayly both morning and Evening upon the golden Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.1.8.36. The golden Altar was a type of the divine nature of the mediator, and the sweet Incense burned thereon by the Priests every day, did typifie his daily mediatorial prayers, as well before as after his death; by which means (among others) he procured his Fathers atonement for his Elect Israel. Once a yeer the high Priest made atonement upon the horns of the golden Altar of Incense with the bloud of the sin-offering of Atonements; <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. but all the rest of the yeer the Priests in general made atonement upon the golden Altar with sweet Incense only, without the bloud of any sacrifice of atonement.</p>
               <p>And when the Lords anger was poured out upon the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Israelites, <hi>Moses</hi> bid <hi>Aaron take fire from the Altar, and put Incense thereon, and run quickly into the Congregation, to make atonement for them, and Aaron did so, and made atonement for them. Num.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Chazkuni</hi> on this place saith, <hi>That the Incense caused death when it was not in the hand of the Priest, but it gave life when it was in the hand of the Priest; for the Priests were anointed and ordained for that service, and so was not</hi> Korah <hi>and his company, he was a chief Levite, but he was not a Priest, and therefore he might
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:117340:77"/> not burne incense; for it did properly belong to the Priests office to put incense (before Iehovah) in thy nostril (or in thine anger)</hi> Deut. 33.10. so then, it is evident that <hi>Aarons</hi> incense did stay the plague as well as the blood of <hi>Davids</hi> burnt-offerings did; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and as well as the Paschal Lamb did; <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.23. <hi>He.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>From these tyipcal resemblances we may learn, that Christ our Mediator did procure his fathers Atonement for all the Elect, by more acts of his mediatorial obedience then one, even by his priestly prayers, as well as by the blood of his oblation; in the daies of his flesh he did often perfume the nostrils of his Father with the sweet incense of his Priestly or mediatorial pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. and himself expressed the efficacy of his mediatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prayers for <hi>Peters</hi> atonement; saying thus to <hi>Peter, thou wilt deny me thrice; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Luke. 22.32</p>
               <p n="4">4. The living <hi>Scape-goat</hi> made atonement for the whole church without shedding of any bloud, as well as the <hi>Goat</hi> that was slain for the peoples sin offering did by the bloud thereof: <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.10.21, 22. This living <hi>Scape-goat</hi> did typifie the escaping of Christ from death by the power of his divine nature; it signified also his ascending into heaven, that he might there present the worke of our atonement by his continual intercession; for none of Gods people have the full fruition of Gods atonement, till they come both body and soul into heaven it self: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</p>
               <p>From all the premises, I think I may well conclude, that your Author is in a great error, to ascribe the whole matter of a sinners righteousness to Christs bloody sacrifice only: neither was his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sacrifice the only procuring cause of his Fathers atonement, but his priestly nature must concur thereto, he made his oblation by his divine nature as wel as by his human; &amp; therfore that action was the Master-peice of his mediatorial obedience, as I have often declared.</p>

               <p>And from this consequence another consequence doth follow it close at the heels, namely this, if his stripes do heal us, then his death and oblation was needless.</p>
               <p>The like argument may be drawn from the wooden cross whereon Christ suffered as a malefactor; <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Christ hath reconciled us to God by his cross: Eph</hi> 2.16. therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else is the matter of our reconciliation but the wooden cross on which Christ was crucified.</p>
               <p>He placeth the matter (I suppose he means the Form) of a sinners righteousnes in Christs passive obedience imputed to sinners as their obedience for their justification, if he had but pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it in the Fathers atonement, then he might better have framed his argument thus: if the Fathers atonement doth clense us from all sin, then it is a needless thing to ad any thing else to it as the formal cause of our righteousnes; for whatsoever doth clense us from all sin, must needs accomplish our full righteousnes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of <hi>Adams</hi> side, and there was a natural u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and presently after she was married to <hi>Adam,</hi> and so there was a matrimonial union; but yet for all this, she was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one person with <hi>Adam,</hi> they still remained two distinct persons, and therefore their personal actions must needs be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
               <p>As for example, in the case of eating the forbidden fruit; <hi>Eves</hi> act in eating the forbidden fruit, was her own personal disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and <hi>Adam</hi> had not bin made a sinner by it (if he had forborn eating) notwithstanding his natural and matrimonial union with her: on the contrary, <hi>Adams</hi> act in eating the forbidden fruit was his own personal act of disobedience, and <hi>Eve</hi> could not have bin corrupted thereby if she had not disobeyed in her own person, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding her natural and matrimonial union with <hi>Adam:</hi> But as soon as both had eaten, both were under the curse of the law by their own personall disobediences; and according to the curse of the law, they both became dead in corruption and sin; and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117340:79"/> thereby they procured not only a corrupt nature to themselves, but to all their posterity; and in this respect the Apostle doth compare the efficacy of Christs mediatorial obedience, to the efficacy of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> disobedience; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p>

               <p>You may as well say that the actions of the head ought to be imputed to the hand, or to the foot, as their proper actions; as say the mediatorial actions of Christ are imputed to each several member of his mystical body; I acknowledge that the actions which are done by the head, are done for the good and benefit of each several member of the body, by reason of their natural union with the head, as fully and as effectually as if every member could have done the very same actings of the head.</p>
               <p>In like sort our blessed Mediator (as he is the mystical head of al believers in the covenant of grace) did take care to do all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of mediatorial obedience that might procure his Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, for the good and benefit of every member of his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, as fully and effectually as if every member could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed those acts of mediatorial obedience themselves: and in this sense God doth impute the efficacy of al Christs mediatorial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all believers as the only meritorious price for the procuring of his Fathers atonement for them: which atonement of the Father doth comprehend under it our full redemption and freedome from

               <p>Therefore whensoever the Father doth actually adopt any to be his Children, he doth it by his spirit through the Mediator; and by that spirit he doth inable them to express their Child-like union, by crying unto him <hi>Abba, Father; Rom.</hi> 8.15. and in this sort the Apostle <hi>Iohn.</hi> doth teach us to extend our union unto the

               <p>The Father begets none (neither from eternity nor in time) without his mean, that is to say, without the Mediator, nor yet without the holy Spirit; and therefore in that respect the holy Spirit is called <hi>the seed of God.</hi>

               <p>Hence I infer, that all the persons in Trinity may be truely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Father in the act of our spiritual generation, though in a differing manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God the Father is our Father efficiently, and in that sense the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>that of his own good will he begat us by the word of truth;</hi> his meaning is, that the Fathers good will and pleasure was the only efficient cause of our adoption, by ordaining the word of truth as the effectual instrument thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The mediator is our Father in the act of our spiritual gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, because he is the meritorious procuring cause of our new birth; and in this respect he is called our <hi>everlasting Father: Isa.</hi> 9.6. because he did from everlasting covenant with his Father to make his soul a mediatorial sacrifice of atonement for the procuring of his Fathers atonement to all the elect, not only for the pardon of their sins, but also for their favorable acceptation; that is to say, for their receiving into the favour of children by adoption; and in this sense Christ is called our <hi>everlasting Father:</hi> namely because he was ordained by the Father to be the procuring cause of our adoption.</p>
               <p>The Father from eternity propounded the conditions of his good wil and pleasure to the mediator to this effect: <hi>if thou wilt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:117340:81"/> become the seed of the woman, and if thou wilt break the divels head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot by giving thy soul a sacrifice for sin, then (I will reward thee for it) I will prolong thy dayes and thou shalt see thy seed; Is.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Ps.</hi> 45.16. <hi>Ps.</hi> 89.4. In all these places the elect are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the seed or the children of Christ the mediator, namely because God gave them to Christ; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. or elected them unto the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of sons in and through the mediator: for he ordained Christ to be the Meritorious procuring cause of their Adoption, <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Christ submits to these conditions and saith, <hi>sacrifice and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou wouldst not have, but a body hast thou prepared me: then said I, lo I come to do thy will O God; by the doing of which will we are sanctified</hi> (or freed from sin, and so made fit to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God) <hi>by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once for all, Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Ps.</hi> 40. Hence it is evident that Christ is our Father, because by his sacrifice of atonement he hath procured his Fathers atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our Redemption, Justification, and Adoption; and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> makes this interrogation, <hi>is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? Deu.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Spirit is our Father also in the first act of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual generation, because he is the principal instrumental cause of our new birth, and therefore he may well be called our Father; for if <hi>Paul</hi> might truly call himself a Father of souls, because he was a sub-ordinate instrument in their new birth; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. Then much more may the holy spirit be called our Father, because he is the principal instrumental cause of our new birth: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect our new birth is attributed to <hi>water and the spirit; Iohn</hi> 3.5.6.8. that is to say, to the <hi>word and spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence also we may see the reason why our Saviour taught us to pray (not to any one person in the Trinity severally, but) to all the Trinity jointly under the name <hi>Father,</hi> saying, <hi>when ye pray say, O our Father which art in heaven. Mat.</hi> 6.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn that none can make an effectual prayer except he pray to all the Trinity; namely to the Father through the Mediator, by the holy Ghost; to pray to any one person alone is idolatry: and thus each person in Trinity is our Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Trinity must have a hand in our regeneration or ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence we may also see the reason why the Father doth not

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>(But your Author denies this, and saith in chap. 19. That adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth neither depend upon, nor flow from the death of Christ; but from his personall property of being the Son of God: this assertion doth directly cross the very scope of that scripture, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. which makes the death of Christ to be the mediatorial procuring cause of the fathers adoption, yea Christ is the mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial procuring cause and way of conveyance of every spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the Father bestows upon us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The formal cause of our adoption, must needs proceed from the Fathers merciful Atonement in receiving sinners into favour, this is the second part of Gods atonement (but your Author in chap. 9. doth greatly blame another learned man, for the dividing the Fathers atonement into Iustification and adoption: he might as well blame our Saviour for dividing the whole law into two great commandments, as blame him for that division; and I think I have already sufficiently justified that division, and yet once more I will do it by and by, in opening the Fathers atonement)</p>
               <p n="4">4. The instrumentall means whereby we receive adoption

And in this regard God could not rest neither in the works of the creation, nor in the first seventh day, until of his great mercy he had manifested his secret counsell from eternity, which was to perfect his creation by the mediator: and for the effecting of this thing to <hi>Adam,</hi> God was pleased to convince <hi>Adam</hi> of his sin, and thereby made him see his miserable lost condition; and then he was pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto him that <hi>the seed of the woman should break the devils▪ head plot:</hi> &amp; he did also teach him the manner how the seed of the woman should break the devils head-plot; namly by teaching him how to offer a Lamb in sacrifice, as a type of that sacrifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Christ the Lamb of God should one day make in the fullness of time (for he was typically slain from the beginning of the world; <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.)</p>

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>The first effect of the Fathers atonement thus procured by Christs mediatorial sacrifice towards poor believing sinners is his mercyful pardon and forgiveness.</p>
               <p>This was typified and promised to all sacrifices of atonement under the Law, first, it was typified and promised to the <hi>sin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi> they were ordained to procure Gods mercyful pardon and forgiveness to the owners; <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.20.26.31.35.

               <p n="2">2. The true nature and extent of Gods mercyful forgiveness is of weighty consideration, for it is of a differing nature from le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal forgiveness: for legal forgiveness doth no more but barely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit a man of his fault and so leaves him: but Gods forgiveness is alwaies mixed with his Fatherly love and pitty; as I have opened the nature of it in <hi>Ps.</hi> 25.18. so that Gods forgiveness d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If God did no more but acquit a sinner of the fault, and so leave him, it could not make a man blessed; but Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness doth make a man blessed, <hi>Ps.</hi> 32.1. therefore his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, This also must be remembred, that no other person in Trinity doth forgive sins formally but God the Father only, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 13. he of his free grace did ordain the Mediator as the meritorious procuring cause of his forgiveness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said that <hi>he doth forgive us all our sins for Christs sake, Eph.</hi> 4.32. somtimes Christ is said to forgive sins; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. but stil we must understand his forgiveness to be in a mediatorial way, and not formally.</p>
               <p>And according to Gods promise in the new Covenant, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness is of that nature, that it doth make a sinner p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
